# Automation
Various scripts and utilities that the Elements of Justice team uses to create the series.

These scripts are written in JavaScript Flash. JSFL is ["an API that extends regular JavaScript to include the Flash Document Object Model"](https://fileinfo.com/extension/jsfl#:~:text=Script%20written%20in%20Flash%20JavaScript,the%20Adobe%20Animate%20authoring%20environment.) 

With the JSFL API, we can encapsulate common tasks, normally taking many steps to complete, into a script that can be run in Adobe Animate. This makes things quicker and easier for our video editors.
