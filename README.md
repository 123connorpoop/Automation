The Elements of Justice webseries is an exciting crossover animation combining elements of the Ace Attorney and My Little Pony universes. With a dedicated team of nearly sixty volunteers, the project has leveraged technology to streamline the production process and improve efficiency for its video editors.

At the heart of this automation lies the use of Flash JavaScript (JSFL), a specialized API that extends traditional JavaScript to offer direct access to the Flash Document Object Model.["a specialized API that extends traditional JavaScript to offer direct access to the Flash Document Object Model."](https://fileinfo.com/extension/jsfl#:~:text=Script%20written%20in%20Flash%20JavaScript,the%20Adobe%20Animate%20authoring%20environment.). This powerful tool allows the team to develop custom scripts and commands that can streamline a variety of video editing tasks.

From minor adjustments like frame shifting and batch library item renaming, to major innovations like automatic scene generators, the Elements of Justice team is always exploring new ways to improve their workflow. The integration of ChatGPT as a component further elevates the professionalism and efficiency of the project, making it an exciting example of the potential of cutting-edge technology in the world of animation.
