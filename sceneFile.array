The defense has that right. || N_Eyes Closed -ingirct, they’re in the lobby right now, ready to testify. || Despair pony who has a fair bit of medical knowledge behind them, and who was in the forest that night. That can only mean—) || Deskslam Hold Exhaustedn’t be Zecora, since she had no idea that the potion had been used until AFTER yesterday’s trial.) || Idle Neutralre they? || Idleny of them. It’d have to be somepony who knows how to make a tourniquet AND identify which potions were healing ones.) || Deskslam Hold Neutralt we already know about this case, it stands to reason that her savior could be one of them.)  || Idle Neutralve you any idea as to who this mysterious helper was? || Idleys no one else was at the statue besides Sweetie Belle. That much might be true… but there WERE other ponies in the forest that night.)  || Thinking Holdle us? Who aided Ms. Sweetie Belle in both of these endeavors? || N_Eyes Closed -ingn answer… So I’d better make this count. Let me think.)  || Idle Neutraluse, that night, Sweetie Belle was neither the one to make the tourniquet, NOR the one to get the healing potion from Zecora. Somepony ELSE did both. || Deskslam Hold Neutralh… I-I mean, I knew that her hut was a little far, but I also knew that she had some healing potions I could use! || Idles no one else at the statue! || Idleppyke a tourniquet! I just used a bunch of stuff I’d collected and pressed against my wound to stop it from bleeding! || Shockrd you took that healing potion? || Deskslam Hold Neutralt, does that also mean you knew where exactly she stored them?  || Deskslam Hold Neutralnitized forest debris against an open wound? And trusted that it would keep it sealed long enough for you to reach Zecora’s hut? || N_Eyes Closed -ingit! || Thinkingt it, I made that tourniquet! || Idley you… can’t make a tourniquet? || Idleve been that somepony whom Sweetie Belle heard, just before she passed out behind the statue… or maybe— || Thinkingiliff, remove the nullifier. || Shocklke one on the night she was attacked? || N_Eyes Closed -ingn’t. || Thinkinggic nullifier removed so she can recreate for us the tourniquet she claims to have made on that night. || Despair to Idlesking the defendant to go back into the Everfree Forest just to grab a bunch of… material?  || Idlete it…? || Thinkinglready have some forest debris here. || Thinkingt’s the case, then you should be able to recreate it for us, right now. || Thinkings! I’ve been practicing outside of our lessons! You just haven’t seen me! || Shock Idlen’t deny that, I suppose… || Thinkingt doesn’t add up either, Sweetie Belle. You and I both know that your magic hasn’t developed that much yet— || Thinkingbly be too rattled to be able to concentrate on making sure every drop of your blood didn’t end up on the forest floor.  || Deskslam Hold Neutralgic to grab stuff from the treeline to make a tourniquet! || Sterngain—why would you bother trying? || Deskslam Hold Neutralctly. You were injured, and bleeding. You’d just passed out and had only just awoken moments beforehand. Not the best condition to be using magic in. || Deskslam Hold Neutralt do you mean why? I was BLEEDING! || Idlet’s easy! I-I used my magic to keep the blood from falling everywhere! || Thinkinggic? Why? || Deskslam Hold Neutralin that? || Deskslam Hold Neutralve gotten any materials to make a tourniquet, she’d have to grab stuff from the treeline!  || Thinkingh! || Thinkingt? || Shock Idlet would mean she’d be dripping blood all over the place! || Angry Facing Forwardt the— || Neutralingt? || Shock Idleh, that’s what happened. || Shock Idleuse, Your Honor—there’s no blood leading from the back of the statue TO the treeline.  || Despair while, I left the statue, seeing that no one was around. I made myself a tourniquet and went to Zecora’s hut to look for a healing potion. || Sternde your tourniquet out of forest debris. And that, I’m afraid, would’ve been impossible for you. || Thinkinglly think about it. I just wanted to get out of there. || Shocklying you made yourself a tourniquet, then made your way to Zecora’s hut. Is that correct? || Deskslam Hold Neutralnd, defendant. Let’s return to when you came to, then. What did you do immediately afterwards? || Idlefter all. || Neutraling time, and then you came to. When you did, did you happen to see if the armor and bloodstain were still in front of the statue? || Deskslam Hold Neutralt you HAD just been attacked and were suffering some blood loss, that would indeed appear to be plausible.  || Condescendingingt HAPPENED after. I think I must have passed out for a little while. || Thinkingw whoever was coming your way? || Deskslam Hold Neutralt all.  || Shockwfully calm about this whole thing…) || Thinkinggic to hide the blood trail that I left while walking behind the statue. || Idleck there?  || Deskslam Hold Neutrals there for a long time… I don’t really remember for how long, exactly. It’s all a bit of a blur. || Shockfterwards, you chose to hide behind the statue. Why did you do that? || Deskslam Hold Neutralng at 10:15, and the quieter one Sweetie caused at the statue around 10:25.) || Deskslam Hold Neutraluse I thought I heard someone coming. And I was afraid it was more animals—more timberwolves, maybe, or a manticore, or something worse.  || Idlet sound about right, Sweetie Belle? || Idle Sadt happened next? || Shock Idleh, it makes sense to me.  || Idlebly… about ten minutes. || Idlet’s right. || Shockrmor pieces together, maybe around the same time, eliciting a loud, clanging sound.  || Idle Neutralsonably assume that you arrived close to 10:25, if not on it.  || Deskslam Hold Neutralfterwards, you started heading towards where you thought it was coming from—the statue. How long did it take you to arrive? || Thinking Holdt story, and decided to do something similar with the armor. I took two pieces and hit them together as hard as I could! || Thinkingcktrack and see if we can figure it out. You heard the first clanging noise at 10:15, didn’t you? || Idle Neutralt did the job, and scared them away! || Sternround what time did you hit the armor pieces together? || Deskslam Hold Neutralther ingenious spur-of-the-moment idea! || Sternbout how her granny scared off a whole pack using nothing but a frying pan. || Idles simple, really. I used the armor to do it.  || Idlet do you mean? || Shock Idlere off the timberwolf, exactly? || Deskslam Hold Neutralttack? || Idle Neutralccounts for the fact that the witness’s blood was found at the scene. || Neutralingtched my right foreleg, enough for me to bleed a little. || Sternt, I’ll first have to break Sweetie Belle’s testimony.) || Indignant Holdy to resolve it is to disprove both Sugar’s and Fair’s entire testimonies, which have been definitive since they back each other up.)  || Thinking Holdttacked me! I managed to scare it off, and afterwards, I hid behind the statue. || Sterny? || Despairse continue. || Idleve been so traumatized that she only THOUGHT she saw Sweetie Belle trip him.  || Thinkingve a LOT of patience, Ms. Cykes. You needn’t worry. || Neutralings Fair Devotion suggested, it’s possible Sugar Stamp was misremembering things that night.  || Idle Neutralt means the timberwolves must have already eaten the body and were in the process of leaving when Sweetie Belle came along.  || Deskslam Hold Neutrall Order’s, of course. The blood test proved that. Sweetie Belle, was there a body present when you saw all of this? || Deskslam Hold Neutralt still leaves Ms. Devotion’s testimony to contradict this one. Defense, tell me you have a plan for resolving that issue. || Skeptical talkims that that Royal Order wasn’t wearing armor, so how did it get there?) || Idle Neutralt contradicts what Sugar Stamp said. She saw Sweetie Belle trip Royal Order—the body had NOT yet been eaten by timberwolves. || Skepticalsn’t a body. || Thinkingnything else near the statue besides those timberwolves? || Idle Neutralrea when you arrived at the statue, and started to approach? || Deskslam Hold Neutralin? || Idlet armor, no doubt, must have belonged to the Royal Order whom Scootaloo crashed into, and who crawled to the statue afterwards.  || Desk Slam Neutralr Stamp kicked Royal Order… if that “confession” wasn’t a load of baloney, that is.) || Deskslam Hold Neutralh, actually. There was a big bloodstain out in front of the statue, and also a set of armor. || Idlet’s correct. || Thinkingme time that Zecora, Diamond Tiara, and Silver Spoon each heard one.)  || Deskslam Hold Neutralck to the testimony. Witness, what happened next? || Neutral_talkinground what time did you hear that clang? || Deskslam Hold Neutralfter I’d arrived, I saw timberwolves approaching the area.  || Thinkings quieter than the other…) || Idle Neutralloo heard two as well. This must have been one of them.  || Deskslam Hold Neutralbly around 10:15. Yeah, that sounds right.  || Shocks loud, and metallic—like a clang.  || Thinkingng? || Idle Neutralst an illumination spell and started heading towards it. || Idlet noise seems to be at the center of everything. Zecora and Diamond Tiara heard one, and Silver Spoon heard two… || Breathing Exerciselly decided to go after them, I headed to the forest entrance. As soon as I got there, I heard a loud noise coming from within. || Thinkingm Hold Neutralnt Rarity to find out, or she’d totally freak! And I didn’t want Scootaloo to do anything dumb… Or anything MORE dumb than stealing from my sister! || Sternck that roll of golden silk, obviously! That thing cost Rarity a small fortune! And Scootaloo stole it right from under my nose! || Idlet the statue? || Idle Neutralt note, I considered following her and Turning into the forest to stop them. || Idles because I found Scootaloo’s note in Carousel Boutique. || Thinkings that? || Idle Neutralloo’s confession to Rarity for taking a roll of golden silk in order to fulfill the blackmailers’ demand.  || Idle Neutralloo’s note? || Shock Idledlly have to say it? || Idlece? And why the statue? || Deskslam Hold Neutralirlly a lot to say. That night, I was at the statue of Nightmare Moon. || Idleny case, I believe we may now begin the cross-examination. Defense, are you ready? || Idlete that the bell did not toll for thee, young one. || N_Eyes Closed -ingh… || Shocks there for a long time… I don’t really remember for how long, exactly. It’s all a bit of a blur. || Shockirt’s up with Prosecutor Luna?) || Thinking Holdttacked me! I managed to scare it off, and afterwards, I hid behind the statue. || Stern place so full of danger in this world, let alone one so close to somewhere as idyllic as Ponyville! || Sternnimals were brutes, but I never imagined they’d go so far as to attack a random filly!  || Sternit a moment! You mean to say—you were almost killed that night by wild timberwolves? || Shock while, I left the statue, seeing that no one was around. I made myself a tourniquet and went to Zecora’s hut to look for a healing potion. || Sternfter I’d arrived, I saw timberwolves approaching the area.  || Thinkingdy to hear the witness’s testimony. || lly a lot to say. That night, I was at the statue of Nightmare Moon. || Idle leap of faith, Athena. That’s all it ever is. || Neutralinglings to your movements on the night of the murder. || Idlelsk you to trust me as well, Sweetie Belle… But I somehow doubt you will.) || Deskslam Hold Neutralt, in the end, the truth WILL be found. Never mind what the Lawkeeper has said. || Condescendingingck then. Asked me to find the truth, in any way that I can. Please. Trust me now. || Thinking Holdround in the dark hoping you’ll find a light switch. Except you don’t know if the room you’re in even has one.  || Thinking Holdt you told me last night?  || Deskslam Hold Neutralling? || Idle Surprise? You… appear somewhat hesitant. || Sternve not dwindled with age, Your Honor.  || Neutral Happyingsk if either the prosecution or defense have any final objections to the matter. Prosecutor Luna, what say you? || Sternve thrown her entire plan for a loop.) || Despair to Idlenk, I… am a bit hesitant.
