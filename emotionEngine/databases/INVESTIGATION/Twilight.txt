Athena! There you are! Where have you been all morning? We were looking everywhere for you!|||Shocked
Sorry, Twilight, I got up early to run a few laps around the castle. As soon as I was done, I rushed over here.|||Neutral 
But, you were already up late last night! How many hours did you actually sleep?|||Confused
Umm, about three, I’d say?|||Confused
Did you at least get something to eat?|||Unamused
I had something to drink after my laps! Nothing like some freshly squeezed orange juice after a good workout!|||Unamused
Just don’t let Applejack hear that.|||Thinking
What was that?|||Thinking
Nothing!|||Shocked
Well, don’t worry, Athena. I’m going to be right there with you throughout the trial.|||Neutral Happy, Turned
You’re right. Thanks again, Twilight, for agreeing to be my aide.|||Neutral Happy, Turned
No problem, Athena!|||Neutral Happy, Turned
(I’m certainly gonna need the help, that’s for sure.)|||Neutral Happy, Turned
…|||Neutral 
No.|||Sad Teary
Wait, they didn’t even tell YOU?|||Sad Teary
No… They didn’t. I’m sorry, Athena.|||Sad Teary
Huh? For what?|||Sad Teary
For not being able to find out who the prosecutor is. I gave you my word that I would, after all…|||Dejected
Twilight, it’s ok, really. I mean, it’s not like it would make THAT much of a difference, right? |||Dejected
The second we walk through those doors, we’re gonna find out exactly who the prosecutor is, anyway.|||Dejected
…|||Sad Teary
Turning, there’s no need to bow to me, really.|||Neutral 
!? |||Shocked
Wait, how did you know I was assisting the defense?|||Shocked
Yes, Turning?|||Neutral 
WHAT!?|||Shocked
Do you realize what’ll happen if we do that? If you’re found guilty, you’ll be banished from Equestria!|||Shocked
They are, but… I… I don’t know…|||Sad Teary
O-Of course, Athena! Now, let's go!|||Shocked
