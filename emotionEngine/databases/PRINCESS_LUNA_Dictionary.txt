I am Princess Luna. A pleasure to meet you, Your Honor.|||Neutral Happying
Just “Prosecutor” will do, Your Honor, and I understand. My sincerest apologies.|||Neutral Happying
A colleague of mine had something they wished to discuss with me, and so it delayed my arrival. Nevertheless, the prosecution is now prepared.|||Neutraling
Ah, Twilight Sparkle. I heard that you would be assisting the defense today.|||Neutral Happying
Heh, I should’ve expected you’d know. You’ve always been the clever one.|||Neutral Happying
Nevertheless, Ms. Sparkle, the reason I’m here is quite simple: it is my duty to uphold the laws of Equestria. I am simply fulfilling that duty. |||N_Eyes Closed -ing
Regardless of whom it is I may be prosecuting, be they adult or child, friend or foe, I plan to fulfill my responsibility to the fullest.|||Neutraling
But of course, being the clever pony that you are, I’m sure you could’ve guessed that, couldn’t you?|||Condescendinging
As for you, defense.|||Neutraling
I must confess, I WAS hoping that the Blue Phoenix would stand against me.|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
His efforts during the TS-5 case, and the case from two days ago, were certainly admirable, twice proving there WAS no murder in our peaceful country.|||Neutral Happying
So, imagine my surprise when I learned that YOU would be the lead on this case instead. |||Neutral Happying
You, whom I have only heard of in hearsay and whispers that began spreading after the trial in Manehattan.|||Condescendinging
I look forward to seeing if you can hold yourself up to the same standards that the Blue Phoenix has set.|||Condescendinging
Is that so? Well, that’s wonderful to hear.|||Condescendinging
At once, Your Honor.|||Neutral Happying
Today’s proceedings shall center around the murder of Royal Order, who had just returned home from Canterlot the night he was killed. |||Neutraling
He was a member of the Royal Guard.|||Neutraling
Rest assured, my little ponies, that there is no cause for alarm. We anticipated this would be the public’s reaction to this news. |||Desk Slam Neutral
That is why we withheld this information until we had all the facts.|||Neutraling
Now that we have investigated this matter in full, we are ready to present the truth behind this stallion’s death to the court, and the public. |||Neutraling
I will begin by submitting the victim’s autopsy report.|||Neutraling
The time of death is estimated to be on the evening of February 12th, between 9:30pm, when the victim was last seen, and 10:30pm, when the body was discovered. |||Reading Scroll
The coroner was able to confirm this during their examination of the body.|||Neutraling
Death came as the result of a single stab wound to the right side of the victim’s head.|||Reading Scroll
It’s not quite that simple, Your Honor. There was only ONE visible wound, but he appears to have been stabbed at least twice. |||N_Eyes Closed -ing
Whether or not this was caused by a single weapon or multiple weapons is unclear. |||Neutraling
What we DO know for certain is that the victim died instantly after just a single stab. All subsequent stabs the victim suffered were post-mortem.|||Reading Scroll
Additionally, we discovered a large bruise on the left side of the victim’s torso, indicating that he was struck by some sort of object. |||Reading Scroll
However, unlike the subsequent stab wounds, the victim received this bruise BEFORE he died.|||
I assume you are referring to the affliction the victim was suffering?|||Neutral Happying
There’s no need to worry, Your Honor. I shall explain. Poison joke is a rare type of flower, native only to the Everfree Forest.|||Neutral Happying
It is relatively harmless, but should one so much as touch the plant, they will be afflicted with a bizarre condition, unique to every individual.|||Neutraling
In the case of Royal Order, the affliction he suffered was weak knees. |||Reading Scroll
Ironic, that a member of the royal guard would be afflicted with a condition that makes it difficult to stand tall.|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
As for the body itself, it was discovered at the foot of the bridge leading to the Castle of the Two Sisters. |||Neutraling
As you can see on this diagram, the castle ruins lie at the very end of the path that cuts through the Everfree Forest.|||Neutraling
Lastly, the prosecution wishes to submit this photo of the crime scene to the court. |||Neutraling
The victim’s body had already been removed for autopsy by the time it was taken, but we laid out tape to mark its exact positioning.|||Neutraling
The ponies accused of committing this wretched crime are Turning Page, the son of the victim, and Scootaloo, a friend of Turning’s.|||Neutraling
It’s certainly a rather tough pill to swallow, but I am certain that, in time, you will come to see that these two were the only ones capable of committing this crime.|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
Trust me, Your Honor, it brings me no pleasure to prosecute these young souls. However, justice must still be served. |||Sad
In the eyes of the law, everypony is equal. “Age” is a non-issue. I trust that you, too, know this, and will remain impartial in your judgement?|||Sad Eyes Forward
I am glad to hear that, Your Honor.|||Neutral Happying
…|||Sad
Your Honor, the prosecution would like to call the detective in charge of this investigation, Private Eye, to the stand.|||Neutral Happying
Witness, please state your name and occupation for the record.|||Neutral Happying
The prosecution’s first course of action will be to make the actions of the victim clear to the court.|||Neutral Happying
Detective, please testify in regards to this matter.|||Neutral Happying
Our investigation determined that Turning Page had gone off into the forest with Scootaloo that night for currently unknown reasons. |||Neutraling
We believe this is why the victim was in the forest that night...|||Neutraling
...he was trying to save his son.|||Sad talk
It is indeed, Your Honor. Figuring out why the victim chose to go so far into the forest was one of the key questions we had during our investigation. |||Neutral Happying
It was the statement of one Ms. Devotion that cleared the matter up for us.|||Reading Scroll
…|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
It’s just as Detective Eye says. |||Neutraling
As someone who gave the victim his orders, I can say with certainty that there was nothing that set him apart from the other guards in our entourage.|||Neutraling
If you’re looking for a motive, defense, I’m sorry to say that you will not find it here.|||Condescendinging
Royal Order often spent many weeks in Canterlot with little time to himself. |||Neutraling
Even when offered extended sabbaticals, he chose to forgo them in service to the crown.|||Neutraling
He was simply honor-bound to serving Equestria and maintaining harmony amongst its citizens.|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
Whenever he wasn’t on active duty, he spent all of his time with his family in Ponyville.|||Neutraling
The forest entrance is roughly 20 minutes away from the victim’s house. |||Neutraling
The crime scene is about 35 minutes away from the entrance. The body was discovered at 10:30pm.|||Neutraling
Do the math, attorney. Do you really think the victim could’ve dawdled before entering the forest?|||Skeptical
What is it, Ms. Sparkle?|||Neutraling
Detective. Do you have the answer to Princess Twilight’s question?|||
You have a point, but, as I’m sure one as proficient in magic as yourself is aware, one cannot teleport to locations that they’ve never been.|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
We could not find any indication that the victim had ever been to the Castle of the Two Sisters before this incident. |||N_Eyes Closed -ing
The best we could uncover were multiple instances of him and his son going to Froggy Bottom Bog, to spar with the monsters that inhabit the area.|||Neutraling
I suppose that’s a reasonable assumption to make. Then, are you saying that between 9:30 and 10:00, the victim was off doing something else?|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
Why? |||Skeptical
His son had gone off into the Everfree Forest alone at night. |||Skeptical
Do you really think he’d waste time delaying his entrance into the forest? |||Skeptical
If anything, he would’ve used the extra half-hour he had to search elsewhere in the woods. After all, it’s not like he could’ve known exactly where his son was.|||Skeptical
A wooden one, Your Honor. No need to worry. I have it right here.|||Neutraling
The defendant has been known to carry this sword everywhere he goes. That night was no different.|||Neutraling
According to our witness, when she last saw the defendant, his sword was still in one piece, yet the sword you see now is broken. |||Reading Scroll
Turning Page’s mother has also confirmed that his sword was undamaged earlier that day. |||Neutraling
The prosecution contends that the sword broke when it was used to attack the victim.|||Skeptical
Before you explain it to us, defense, I would like you to tell us from where you learned this alternate interpretation.|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
From the defendant himself, in other words? Do you truly believe that story to be reliable, in that case?|||Skeptical
Unless you have some proof to back up his story, I think you’d do well to keep it to yourself for now.|||Condescendinging
In any case, the prosecution recognizes that our own evidence on the matter is circumstantial. More definitive evidence may yet prove our claim to be false.|||
At the moment, however, this interpretation of the facts surrounding the sword is the most likely scenario.|||Skeptical
It was not, Your Honor. There wasn’t a single trace of blood on the sword. No forensic spell or potion could reveal even a single drop.|||
It was a possession belonging to the other defendant: Ms. Scootaloo. She stabbed him using her scooter.|||Desk Slam Neutral
You can see it in the photo I submitted earlier, Your Honor. |||Neutraling
When tested, we discovered that the blood was indeed the victim’s.|||Skeptical
...|||Sad
Yes, enlighten us, defense. What is this supposed contradiction?|||Condescendinging
Hmph. You certainly pose an interesting dilemma, defense. |||Condescendinging
So, are you implying that the victim was first stabbed in the head, and THEN hit in the torso? |||Condescendinging
It would certainly help your case, if you were. |||Condescendinging
After all, a child would have a much more difficult time trying to stab a fully grown stallion in the head if he were standing up straight, even IF one of them was a unicorn.|||Condescendinging
Intriguing… And why not, defense?|||Condescendinging
Hmph.|||Condescendinging
Of course I do.|||Condescendinging
At once, Your Honor. |||Neutral Happying
As the defense has so eagerly demonstrated for us, the victim’s autopsy report creates quite a few perplexing contradictions. |||Skeptical talk
However, there are two explanations that can clear them all up.|||Condescendinging
The first is a rather simple one. |||Neutraling
After the victim was struck, he fell onto something sharp, and it pierced his head, killing him.|||Desk slam normal talk
Well, it may not be right to call it a “murder” weapon. |||sad talk right
After all, there’s no proof to indicate that the assailant ever intended on killing the victim, should this be the case.|||Skeptical talk
And the crime scene WAS a forest, after all. Who knows what could be on the ground? All kinds of dangerous objects, I’m sure.|||Desk slam normal talk
Not if the culprit took it away in a panic, or in fear.|||Neutraling
That could’ve been the result of our real culprit wishing to frame Ms. Scootaloo for the crime. |||Desk slam normal talk
Even if it was an accident, the culprit still wouldn’t want to be caught. They would likely fabricate a weapon to avoid their punishment.|||Skeptical talk
In truth, while the stab wound in question IS quite similar in shape to the exposed bolt on the scooter...|||Skeptical talk
Irregularities WERE discovered during examination, which indicates that it’s possible two different items could’ve stabbed the victim.|||Desk slam normal talk
Indeed, Your Honor. The evidence, as it stands, suggests that Turning Page was the one who knocked the victim over. |||Neutraling
On top of that, out of the two defendants, he’s the only one who would benefit from making a fake weapon out of the scooter.|||Skeptical talk
What do YOU think, defense? |||Condescendinging
Do you wish to argue that this was all an accident, perpetrated by Turning Page alone?|||Condescendinging
Undoubtedly, the victim was knocked over after he was hit, but who’s to say that’s also when he died?|||attention talk
Yes, I do. The victim was NOT stabbed when he was knocked to the ground. |||attention talk
Instead, after he was knocked over, he managed to stand himself back up. |||attention talk
After an unspecified amount of time, he was then stabbed in the RIGHT temple, which caused him to fall over onto his LEFT side!|||attention talk
If you wish to pursue the theory of the body having been moved, you’ll need to first disprove that he was killed at the castle ruins. |||attention talk
All of the evidence presented in the trial so far points towards the likelihood of the murder occurring there. |||attention talk
Furthermore, nothing was missing from the crime scene to suggest that the murder may have occurred elsewhere. Right, defense?|||attention talk
…|||N_eyes-closed - talk
Interesting claim, Golden Pixie. And you sounded so triumphant while making it, too...|||attention talk
It's a shame that it’s completely flawed.|||N_eyes-closed - talk
True, there doesn’t appear to be any blood on the scene right now, but once I bring my next witness to the stand, that tune of yours will surely change.|||N_eyes-closed - talk
Witness, please state your name and occupation for the record.|||
Let’s get back on topic, shall we? |||Neutral_talking
Witness, is it true that, on the night of the murder, you were the one who discovered and reported the victim’s body?|||attention talk
