Hmm? Oh, it's you guys again.|||Frown
Uh… yeah. We’re here to see Sweetie Belle. Is she here?|||Frown
She’s currently in questioning right now. You’ll have to come back later.|||Frown
(Geez. Talk about a stick in the mud. This guy never lets up, does he?)|||Frown
Ms. Fair Devotion stopped by a moment ago to pick them up, Your Highness. |||Frown
I don’t know where else she’d be.|||Smile
Such as?|||Frown
They were questioned for a little while, then they were later released with no charges filed against them. Their parents came and picked them up not too long ago.|||Frown
No charges, huh?|||Frown
(No prizes for guessing why THAT is.)|||
She left soon after the trial was over, and was seen heading back to the Everfree Forest.|||Frown
Straight back home, I suppose. |||Frown
After what you put her through? That zebra deserves a lot more than rest, that’s for sure.|||Smile
...|||Smile
(I’m well aware of that…)|||Smile
Anything else?|||Frown
Correct. He and his team are currently tracking down Ms. Sugar Stamp.|||Frown
And when WILL he be back?|||Frown
Whenever they find her, I should think.|||Smile
(Gee, thanks. At this point I don’t know why I expected anything from this guy.)|||Smile
In any case, Ms. Sweetie Belle will not be released from questioning for some time. |||Frown
If you have any further questions, ask them now. Otherwise, I have to get back to my shift. I already have a long enough day as is…|||Mega Frown
