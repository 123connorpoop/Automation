My name is Private Eye, Princess. Detective. And might I say, good morning to everyone present. Princess Twilight, Ms. Cykes, My Lord. |||Happy_Neutral
At once, Your Highness.|||Happy_Neutral
The victim, Royal Order, was stationed in Canterlot until late afternoon on the day of his murder.|||Neutral
After his shift ended, he boarded a train and arrived in Ponyville at around a quarter past nine that night.|||Neutral
Upon his return home, he was informed of Turning’s whereabouts, and decided to head into the Everfree Forest to find him.|||Thinking
When he arrived at the base of the bridge, in front of the Castle of the Two Sisters, he was ambushed, and murdered.|||Concerned
The victim’s wife, Fair Devotion. She’s a substitute teacher at the local schoolhouse.|||Happy_Neutral
While her husband was away in Canterlot, Ms. Devotion would take care of her son all by herself. |||Happy_Neutral
This on top of her demanding role as a teacher and member of the Ponyville school board, you see.|||Thinking
She was home when the victim returned, and it was she who told him that Turning Page had gone into the forest that night.|||Neutral
That is what the evidence and statement currently point to, yes.|||Thinking
He was performing his routine duties as a guard. Nothing out of the ordinary.|||Happy_Neutral
Monitoring doors, patrolling hallways, the standard fare.|||Thinking
I suppose you could say that, yes.|||Thinking
...|||Thinking
Well, as a detective, I can only know so much. What do you think, Princess Luna?|||Thinking
Well, there you have it. You couldn’t ask for a clearer answer than that.|||Happy_Neutral
Nearly a month, according to our findings.|||Happy_Neutral
He certainly was the epitome of a royal guardspony. |||Concerned
His death will surely echo a great sense of loss for both his country… and those close to him…|||Concerned
The day he was murdered was no different than any of his other off-duty times.|||Neutral
He returned to Ponyville to visit his family.|||Thinking
According to our investigation into the ticket purchases and train schedules for February 12th, Royal’s train arrived in Ponyville at a quarter past nine. |||Thinking
He then headed straight home, arriving about ten minutes later.|||Thinking
Indeed. We heard this from Ms. Devotion herself.|||Happy_Neutral
During our investigation of the victim’s house, we found a note written in Turning’s horn-writing confessing to his actions that night. |||Thinking
Ms. Devotion knew where her son had gone because of this note.|||Neutral
As you said yourself, the Everfree Forest is a dangerous place, especially after dark. |||Neutral
She knew Royal Order would be coming home soon, so she decided to wait until the more able-bodied pony had arrived before attempting to follow after her son.|||Thinking
According to Ms. Devotion, when Royal Order offered to go find him, she insisted on going with her husband, but he told her to stay put. |||Thinking
She reluctantly complied, and watched him leave at around half past nine. That was the last time she ever saw him. |||Neutral
I beg your pardon? |||Neutral
Hmm, I’m afraid we neglected to look into this matter, so I cannot say anything for certain.|||Thinking
I do indeed, Your Highness. Royal Order was an incredibly gifted unicorn. Teleportation was just one of many spells he had long since mastered.|||Happy_Neutral
Quite so. You can see it here on the map we drew of the forest.|||Happy_Neutral
We believe so, yes.|||Neutral
It was the bruise on the left side of his body. |||Thinking
We believe that the assailant first delivered the blow to his torso, in order to knock the victim to the ground. |||Thinking
This was then followed up by at least two stabs to the head, the first of which must have killed the victim.|||Thinking
If the victim had been on guard at the time, there isn’t a chance somepony of his caliber would have been knocked down so easily.|||Neutral
That is why we believe he was taken by surprise.|||Neutral
Perhaps… But you are forgetting something else, Ms. Cykes.|||Thinking
The victim was suffering from the effects of poison joke.|||Neutral
Exactly. The poison joke caused the victim’s legs to be weaker than normal. |||Neutral
So, when his assailant struck him, even if he was completely on guard, it’s hard to believe he WOULDN’T have been knocked to the ground.|||Neutral
We believe it was the sword of the defendant Turning Page, My Lord.|||Neutral
Not normally, My Lord, but in this case, the scooter in question was broken.|||Thinking
The left handlebar was snapped off, leaving behind a sharp, exposed bolt that could easily puncture a body.|||Neutral
As regrettable as it is to think so, the evidence certainly points to that conclusion. |||Concerned
Certainly, My Lord.|||Happy_Neutral
The victim was knocked to the ground, and then stabbed before he could even react.|||Thinking
Oh? Please, do tell.|||Thinking
!?|||Shock
Of course, My Lord.|||Bow
