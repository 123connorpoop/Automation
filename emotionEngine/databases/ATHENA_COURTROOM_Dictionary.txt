(That’s weird, the prosecution is missing… Wait, why’s the judge still here?)|||Idle Neutral
Y-Yes, Your Honor, but… um… you’re still here, then?|||Despair
(Is it really a vacation if you’re still working…?)|||Despair Hold
I’ll admit, I don’t have much experience with them, but I suppose it could be fun to watch.|||Cringe Exhausted
So... uh, why are you here exactly, Your Honor? In court, I mean?|||Thinking
(That’s odd… Wasn’t that supposed to be one of Princess Celestia’s responsibilities?)|||Thinking Hold
(The only reason she wasn’t the judge for the previous trial was because Twilight specifically requested it.) |||Thinking Hold
(But that doesn’t seem to be the case this time… Just what is going on here?)|||Thinking Hold
(Forget hearing their answer. I’d settle for just seeing them!)|||
(About time…)|||Deskslam Hold Angry
Huh?|||Deskslam Surprise
(Wait! She has wings… and a horn… Does that mean...)|||Deskslam Hold Exhausted
A-A princess!?|||Despair
(Princess Luna, huh? So she IS an alicorn, just like Twilight. I suppose that makes sense, given that she’s a princess and all.) |||Thinking Hold
(That name, though… it sounds familiar… Wait!)|||Thinking Hold
It was where Equestria’s current rulers - Princesses Celestia and Luna - used to live.|||Thinking Hold
(Oh, that’s right! She’s one of Equestria’s leaders. Ugh… just my luck! How am I supposed to keep up with the ruler of an entire country!?)|||Thinking Hold
(Okay, relax! Just... focus on the case. Still, something about her appearance…  Have I seen her somewhere before…?)|||Despair to Idle
Hey, Twilight, have—|||Wary Neutral
Huh? M-me?|||Idle Neutral
B-Blue Phoenix?|||Despair
Hmph. You’ll see. I WILL live up to his example. With Twilight by my side, Scootaloo and Turning Page are as good as free.|||Cross Sad
Alright, let’s do this! Ready, Twilight?|||Fist Palm Hold Happy
(That’s right. Private Eye mentioned something about keeping the victim’s identity a secret from the public. Looks like that was the right call.)|||Thinking Hold
(In other words, the only thing we need to be concerned with is figuring out how the victim suffered his initial stab wound - THAT’S what killed him.)|||Deskslam Hold Neutral
(What I’m still wondering is… Why did the killer stab the victim in the head, of all places? That’s way too bizarre to not be important.)|||Thinking Hold
(Yeah, this is all stuff that Twilight mentioned yesterday.)|||Idle Neutral
Your Honor, we stand by our plea of “Not Guilty.” The defendants, Turning Page and Scootaloo, are both completely innocent of the charges filed against them! |||Cross Happy
(All right. Private Eye’s up first, then. Hopefully he doesn’t say anything too damaging.)|||Idle Neutral
(Aaaand, we’ve already lost him.)|||Cringe Exhausted
So, the reason the victim went into the forest was to chase after his son?|||Thinking
(It’s hard to argue against that. I guess in that case, I’ll just see what other information I can draw out of Private Eye.)|||Thinking Hold
What was he doing there?|||Idle Neutral
What did those duties entail?|||Idle Neutral
So, he was just your average, everyday guard?|||Thinking
There was nothing special about his rank, his title… anything at all?|||Thinking
Grh!|||Despair
(Shoot. I was really hoping I would get something out of that.) |||Idle Neutral
(If he was just an ordinary guard, then that eliminates any potential motive that could be tied to his rank.)|||Thinking Hold
(Still, though, the way Private Eye shifted my question to Princess Luna… Something still doesn’t seem right here.)|||Wary Neutral
Ah! Uh, y-yes! S-Sorry, Your Honor.|||Despair
(I’ll have to look into that later. Gotta continue pressing the detective for information now.)|||Despair to Idle
How long had he stayed in Canterlot?|||Idle Neutral
A-A month?!|||Despair
(Heh, says the guy working on his “vacation.”)|||Idle Neutral
(Hm?!)|||Wary Surprise
(That’s odd…  That sounded a lot more sorrowful than anything I would expect from Private Eye.)|||Wary Surprise
So, it was Fair Devotion who told the victim that Turning Page had gone into the forest?|||Idle Neutral
And how did she know what her son was doing? I doubt she would’ve allowed Turning to go somewhere that dangerous.|||Thinking
(“Went to the Everfree Forest. Be back soon.” Succinct and straight to the point. Just what I would expect from Turning.) |||Idle Neutral
If Ms. Devotion was the one who discovered this note, why didn’t SHE go after him as soon as she found it?|||Idle Neutral
Did the victim make any stops on his way to the forest?|||Thinking
I’m just wondering if it’s possible that the victim went somewhere else before entering the Everfree Forest.|||Thinking
Considering there was only five extra minutes to do something else, I highly doubt it…|||Thinking
You mean…|||Despair
Froggy Bottom Bog, huh… I think I heard about that place yesterday. |||Thinking
It’s down the path that leads to the right from the crossroads, isn’t it? |||Idle Neutral
So, that means he could at least teleport as far as the crossroads, right? |||Thinking
He must have been there before when traveling to his sparring sessions.|||Thinking
If so, then he may have teleported to the crossroads first, and walked the rest of the way to the castle. |||Thinking
This could make his travel time 30 minutes at most.|||Idle Neutral
Rgh! |||Cringe Angry
(Yeah… That’s true. It’s kind of hard to believe that Royal Order would’ve risked his son’s safety by taking a detour, given what we’ve heard about him so far.)|||Idle Neutral
Sorry, Your Honor. Private, please continue.|||Idle Sad
He was ambushed?|||Thinking
What led you to that conclusion?|||Deskslam Hold Neutral
But walking through that dark, dangerous forest in the middle of the night… Wouldn’t the victim have been on guard regardless?|||Thinking
Ah! Weak knees!|||Shock
(I guess that’s true…)|||Idle Neutral
It says so right here in the autopsy report.|||Idle Neutral
The victim suffered a large bruise on the left side of his torso ANTE-MORTEM.|||Idle Neutral
He was hit BEFORE he was killed!|||Objection
Since the autopsy report notes that the victim was instantly killed by the first stab wound...|||Objection Neutral
...That means that it would’ve been impossible for the victim to have been struck in the torso after he was stabbed!|||Objection Neutral
(I… I did it… I managed to find a flaw in the prosecution’s case!)|||Idle Surprise
Yeah, that’s what I thou—|||Cross Happy
Wait, what…?|||Despair
T-Two?|||Despair
!!!|||Idle Surprise
(You’re going up against the wrong person if you think you can manipulate me into saying what you want, Princess!) |||Deskslam Hold Angry
(That being said, if I did argue that this was what happened, I could get Turning Page’s sentence reduced significantly, and Scootaloo would be off the hook completely.)|||Thinking Hold
(Is that what I should do? Turning DID say he’d be willing to take the blame for this… But…)|||Thinking Hold
(Turning’s looking at me. Is he trying to tell me to let him take the fall? But if I do that, then...)|||Idle Neutral
No, Your Honor. I do not.|||Idle Neutral
The defense’s stance is simply this: We assert that neither Scootaloo nor Turning Page had any hand, or hoof, rather, in this murder!|||Idle Mad
