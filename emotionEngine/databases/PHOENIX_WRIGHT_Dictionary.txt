Trust me, Twilight, this is nothing out of the ordinary for Athena.|||Smile
You’re still worried about defending both Scootaloo and Turning Page, aren’t you?|||Serious
Y-Yeah, just a little bit. But I’m fine! I’m just… a little on edge, y’know?|||Serious
By the way, Twilight, did you manage to get any info about the prosecutor?|||Thinking
You did the best you could, Twilight. That’s all anyone could ask for.|||Smile
Wait a minute. Sweetie Belle, how did you know that Scootaloo stole the fabric in the first place?|||Serious
Even close friends can still doubt each other… But, not typically without a VERY good reason...|||Sad
I know this is a big step for you as a lawyer, but we all start somewhere. |||Thinking
It’s time for you to take that next leap forward. I’m confident you’ll succeed. You’ll always have my full support.|||Smile
Boss...|||Smile
We got this, right Twilight?|||Smile
