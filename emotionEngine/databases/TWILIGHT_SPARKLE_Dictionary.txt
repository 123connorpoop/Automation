Athena! There you are! Where have you been all morning? We were looking everywhere for you!|||Shocked
Sorry, Twilight, I got up early to run a few laps around the castle. As soon as I was done, I rushed over here.|||Neutral 
But, you were already up late last night! How many hours did you actually sleep?|||Confused
Umm, about three, I’d say?|||Confused
Did you at least get something to eat?|||Unamused
I had something to drink after my laps! Nothing like some freshly squeezed orange juice after a good workout!|||Unamused
Just don’t let Applejack hear that.|||Thinking
What was that?|||Thinking
Nothing!|||Shocked
Well, don’t worry, Athena. I’m going to be right there with you throughout the trial.|||Neutral Happy, Turned
You’re right. Thanks again, Twilight, for agreeing to be my aide.|||Neutral Happy, Turned
No problem, Athena!|||Neutral Happy, Turned
(I’m certainly gonna need the help, that’s for sure.)|||Neutral Happy, Turned
…|||Neutral 
No.|||Sad Teary
Wait, they didn’t even tell YOU?|||Sad Teary
No… They didn’t. I’m sorry, Athena.|||Sad Teary
Huh? For what?|||Sad Teary
For not being able to find out who the prosecutor is. I gave you my word that I would, after all…|||Dejected
Twilight, it’s ok, really. I mean, it’s not like it would make THAT much of a difference, right? |||Dejected
The second we walk through those doors, we’re gonna find out exactly who the prosecutor is, anyway.|||Dejected
…|||Sad Teary
Turning, there’s no need to bow to me, really.|||Neutral 
!? |||Shocked
Wait, how did you know I was assisting the defense?|||Shocked
Yes, Turning?|||Neutral 
WHAT!?|||Shocked
Do you realize what’ll happen if we do that? If you’re found guilty, you’ll be banished from Equestria!|||Shocked
They are, but… I… I don’t know…|||Sad Teary
O-Of course, Athena! Now, let's go!|||Shocked
Don’t doubt yourself, Athena.|||Breathing Exercise
Twilight?|||Breathing Exercise
If you think there’s a contradiction, then go for it. I’ll be right here with you.|||Turned, Happy
Right. Thanks, Twilight! |||Turned, Happy
That can’t be it, Athena. Think back to the autopsy report one more time.|||Thinking
Ah! You’re right, Twilight!|||Thinking
Way to go, Athena!|||Turned, Happy
Let’s see how the Princess tries to get out of this one.|||Turned, Happy
Athena?|||Turned, Concerned
I’m… not sure what to do here, Twilight. The way things are going, I could very easily get Scootaloo off the hook, and Turning a light prison sentence. |||Turned, Concerned
Hmm, that WOULD have everything turn out just as Turning asked back in the defendant lobby.|||Thinking
But, I don’t think I should do that.|||Thinking
...|||Breathing Exercise
If I do… That’ll just mean we’re admitting that Turning killed his own father, even if only by accident, and that will undoubtedly have a severe effect on him.|||Breathing Exercise
His family, his peers… They’d never look at him or treat him the same way again.|||Breathing Exercise
It’d ruin his life!|||Breathing Exercise
Even so, Turning seems to be satisfied with that.|||Neutral (that should've FUCKING EXISTED DAY 1)
Well, I’m not! I don’t care if he thinks it’d be a good thing to do, because it isn’t! |||Breathing Exercise
I’m supposed to look out for both his and Scootaloo’s best interests, and him taking the blame isn’t what she wants!  |||Breathing Exercise
So if Luna’s got some sort of trap waiting for me, bring it on! I’ll never admit that either of them had anything to do with Royal Order’s death!|||Breathing Exercise
…|||Breathing Exercise
If that’s the path you’re going down, then don’t you worry; I’ve got your back!|||Turned, Happy
Thank you, Twilight. |||Turned, Happy
Oh, right. I guess I forgot to mention that, didn’t I?|||Embarassed
You and Apple Bloom both…|||Embarassed
