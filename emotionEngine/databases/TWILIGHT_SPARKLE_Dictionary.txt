What about Scootaloo and Turning Page? Are they still here?|||Confused
Wait! Rainbow!|||Shocked
Wait! Rainbow!|||Shocked
Let her go, Twilight. I kind of expected that to happen.|||Shocked
Fine. I have some more questions to ask, anyway.|||Unamused
Can you tell us what happened to Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon?|||Neutral 
There’s another thing I’d like to know. Where’s Zecora?|||Thinking
Just one more thing, actually. Is Private Eye still in Canterlot?|||Neutral 
R-right… No, I think that’s everything. Thank you for your help.|||Neutral 
Well, what’s our next course of action?|||Thinking
We should go to Fair Devotion’s house, since that’s where Scootaloo and Turning Page are. Rainbow Dash has more than likely made it to them, knowing her. |||Thinking
What is it, Rarity?|||Confused
