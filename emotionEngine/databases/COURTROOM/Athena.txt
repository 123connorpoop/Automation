(That’s weird, the prosecution is missing… Wait, why’s the judge still here?)|||Idle Neutral
Y-Yes, Your Honor, but… um… you’re still here, then?|||Despair
(Is it really a vacation if you’re still working…?)|||Despair Hold
I’ll admit, I don’t have much experience with them, but I suppose it could be fun to watch.|||Cringe Exhausted
So... uh, why are you here exactly, Your Honor? In court, I mean?|||Thinking
(That’s odd… Wasn’t that supposed to be one of Princess Celestia’s responsibilities?)|||Thinking Hold
(The only reason she wasn’t the judge for the previous trial was because Twilight specifically requested it.) |||Thinking Hold
(But that doesn’t seem to be the case this time… Just what is going on here?)|||Thinking Hold
(Forget hearing their answer. I’d settle for just seeing them!)|||
(About time…)|||Deskslam Hold Angry
Huh?|||Deskslam Surprise
(Wait! She has wings… and a horn… Does that mean...)|||Deskslam Hold Exhausted
A-A princess!?|||Despair
(Princess Luna, huh? So she IS an alicorn, just like Twilight. I suppose that makes sense, given that she’s a princess and all.) |||Thinking Hold
(That name, though… it sounds familiar… Wait!)|||Thinking Hold
It was where Equestria’s current rulers - Princesses Celestia and Luna - used to live.|||Thinking Hold
(Oh, that’s right! She’s one of Equestria’s leaders. Ugh… just my luck! How am I supposed to keep up with the ruler of an entire country!?)|||Thinking Hold
(Okay, relax! Just... focus on the case. Still, something about her appearance…  Have I seen her somewhere before…?)|||Despair to Idle
Hey, Twilight, have—|||Wary Neutral
Huh? M-me?|||Idle Neutral
B-Blue Phoenix?|||Despair
Hmph. You’ll see. I WILL live up to his example. With Twilight by my side, Scootaloo and Turning Page are as good as free.|||Cross Sad
Alright, let’s do this! Ready, Twilight?|||Fist Palm Hold Happy
(That’s right. Private Eye mentioned something about keeping the victim’s identity a secret from the public. Looks like that was the right call.)|||Thinking Hold
(In other words, the only thing we need to be concerned with is figuring out how the victim suffered his initial stab wound - THAT’S what killed him.)|||Deskslam Hold Neutral
(What I’m still wondering is… Why did the killer stab the victim in the head, of all places? That’s way too bizarre to not be important.)|||Thinking Hold
(Yeah, this is all stuff that Twilight mentioned yesterday.)|||Idle Neutral
Your Honor, we stand by our plea of “Not Guilty.” The defendants, Turning Page and Scootaloo, are both completely innocent of the charges filed against them! |||Cross Happy
(All right. Private Eye’s up first, then. Hopefully he doesn’t say anything too damaging.)|||Idle Neutral
(Aaaand, we’ve already lost him.)|||Cringe Exhausted
So, the reason the victim went into the forest was to chase after his son?|||Thinking
(It’s hard to argue against that. I guess in that case, I’ll just see what other information I can draw out of Private Eye.)|||Thinking Hold
What was he doing there?|||Idle Neutral
What did those duties entail?|||Idle Neutral
So, he was just your average, everyday guard?|||Thinking
There was nothing special about his rank, his title… anything at all?|||Thinking
Grh!|||Despair
(Shoot. I was really hoping I would get something out of that.) |||Idle Neutral
(If he was just an ordinary guard, then that eliminates any potential motive that could be tied to his rank.)|||Thinking Hold
(Still, though, the way Private Eye shifted my question to Princess Luna… Something still doesn’t seem right here.)|||Wary Neutral
Ah! Uh, y-yes! S-Sorry, Your Honor.|||Despair
(I’ll have to look into that later. Gotta continue pressing the detective for information now.)|||Despair to Idle
How long had he stayed in Canterlot?|||Idle Neutral
A-A month?!|||Despair
(Heh, says the guy working on his “vacation.”)|||Idle Neutral
(Hm?!)|||Wary Surprise
(That’s odd…  That sounded a lot more sorrowful than anything I would expect from Private Eye.)|||Wary Surprise
So, it was Fair Devotion who told the victim that Turning Page had gone into the forest?|||Idle Neutral
And how did she know what her son was doing? I doubt she would’ve allowed Turning to go somewhere that dangerous.|||Thinking
(“Went to the Everfree Forest. Be back soon.” Succinct and straight to the point. Just what I would expect from Turning.) |||Idle Neutral
If Ms. Devotion was the one who discovered this note, why didn’t SHE go after him as soon as she found it?|||Idle Neutral
Did the victim make any stops on his way to the forest?|||Thinking
I’m just wondering if it’s possible that the victim went somewhere else before entering the Everfree Forest.|||Thinking
Considering there was only five extra minutes to do something else, I highly doubt it…|||Thinking
You mean…|||Despair
Froggy Bottom Bog, huh… I think I heard about that place yesterday. |||Thinking
It’s down the path that leads to the right from the crossroads, isn’t it? |||Idle Neutral
So, that means he could at least teleport as far as the crossroads, right? |||Thinking
He must have been there before when traveling to his sparring sessions.|||Thinking
If so, then he may have teleported to the crossroads first, and walked the rest of the way to the castle. |||Thinking
This could make his travel time 30 minutes at most.|||Idle Neutral
Rgh! |||Cringe Angry
(Yeah… That’s true. It’s kind of hard to believe that Royal Order would’ve risked his son’s safety by taking a detour, given what we’ve heard about him so far.)|||Idle Neutral
Sorry, Your Honor. Private, please continue.|||Idle Sad
He was ambushed?|||Thinking
What led you to that conclusion?|||Deskslam Hold Neutral
But walking through that dark, dangerous forest in the middle of the night… Wouldn’t the victim have been on guard regardless?|||Thinking
Ah! Weak knees!|||Shock
(I guess that’s true…)|||Idle Neutral
It says so right here in the autopsy report.|||Idle Neutral
The victim suffered a large bruise on the left side of his torso ANTE-MORTEM.|||Idle Neutral
He was hit BEFORE he was killed!|||Objection
Since the autopsy report notes that the victim was instantly killed by the first stab wound...|||Objection Neutral
...That means that it would’ve been impossible for the victim to have been struck in the torso after he was stabbed!|||Objection Neutral
(I… I did it… I managed to find a flaw in the prosecution’s case!)|||Idle Surprise
Yeah, that’s what I thou—|||Cross Happy
Wait, what…?|||Despair
T-Two?|||Despair
!!!|||Idle Surprise
(You’re going up against the wrong person if you think you can manipulate me into saying what you want, Princess!) |||Deskslam Hold Angry
(That being said, if I did argue that this was what happened, I could get Turning Page’s sentence reduced significantly, and Scootaloo would be off the hook completely.)|||Thinking Hold
(Is that what I should do? Turning DID say he’d be willing to take the blame for this… But…)|||Thinking Hold
(Turning’s looking at me. Is he trying to tell me to let him take the fall? But if I do that, then...)|||Idle Neutral
No, Your Honor. I do not.|||Idle Neutral
The defense’s stance is simply this: We assert that neither Scootaloo nor Turning Page had any hand, or hoof, rather, in this murder!|||Idle Mad(Can life cut me a break already!? It’s hard enough sifting through testimonies without having to decipher them first!)|||Cringe Exhausted
You saw… blood on the ground… around the body?|||Despair
That’s… That’s impossible! We checked the area ourselves! Even this photograph shows there were no traces of blood! Your testimony is completely contradictory!|||Despair
That’s… That’s impossible! We checked the area ourselves! Even this photograph shows there were no traces of blood! Your testimony is completely contradictory!|||Despair
That’s… That’s impossible! We checked the area ourselves! Even this photograph shows there were no traces of blood! Your testimony is completely contradictory!|||Despair
?!|||Despair Hold
But… why was it gone the next day?|||Thinking
(That must be the third cape that Private Eye said the police had taken for examination.)|||Idle Neutral
What?!|||Shock
What?!|||Shock
… Gnk! You mean… That pool of blood Zecora saw…|||Deskslam Hold Sad
AAARRRRGGGHHH!!!|||Shock
AAARRRRGGGHHH!!!|||Shock
Uuuggghhh…|||Despair Hold
NO! This… this can’t be right!|||Despair
NO! This… this can’t be right!|||Despair
(No… please… no more...)|||Distress
(Not if I don’t wanna get held in contempt of court...)|||
(Ugh. Just… ignore her! Ignore everyone, okay?) |||Cringe Angry
(Ugh. Just… ignore her! Ignore everyone, okay?) |||Deskslam Hold Neutral
(I’m not gonna lose! Time to get my brain in gear! There HAS to be something off in her theory.) |||Deskslam Hold Neutral
(Luna’s saying that the body was never moved… The reason there was no blood at the scene is because it was absorbed by the cape…) |||Thinking Hold
(In that case, the victim would’ve stood up after being knocked over by Turning…) |||Thinking Hold
(Afterwards, Scootaloo hit him in the head with the scooter, which knocked him to the ground again… Is there anything wrong with that series of events?) |||Thinking Hold
…|||Thinking Hold
(Wait a second… If the victim was standing UP when he was stabbed, then wouldn’t it be impossible for—)|||Thinking Hold
Aaah!|||Shock
Aaah!|||Shock
Uhh… you bet I do!|||Idle Sad
Your Honor, the defense would like to point out a flaw in the prosecution’s theory.|||Objection Neutral
Y-yes, Your Honor! The issue has to do with the victim’s fatal stab wound being inflicted while the victim was standing upright.|||Despair
I would think stabbing an adult at such a height would be nearly impossible for a child, correct?|||Idle Neutral
Funny you should mention that. I heard something from the defendant in question yesterday that clears up this matter. Namely, the fact that Ms. Scootaloo… can’t fly.|||Cross Happy
(Can I take you by surprise at least ONCE in this trial?)|||Despair Hold
?!|||Deskslam Hold Neutral
!!!|||Despair
!!!|||Despair
Uh-oh…|||Despair
RGH!!!|||Deskslam Hold Angry
RGH!!!|||Deskslam Hold Angry
(Oh yeah. I kinda forgot that Zecora was even here.)|||
You were tending to plants?|||Idle Neutral
Including that poison joke in front of your home?|||Idle Neutral
Are these plants of yours hard to find?|||Idle Neutral
So you scour the forest for plants. Did you happen to do that on the day of the murder?|||Thinking
Did you happen to visit the Castle of the Two Sisters that day?|||Idle Neutral
… Uh… Just to confirm… The body didn’t happen to be at the foot of the bridge at that time… did it?|||Wary Neutral
(Well, at least I got SOME information. Not exactly sure how helpful it was, though.)|||Idle Neutral
Did you happen to see who they were? |||Deskslam Hold Neutral
(They were going to settle the blackmail with Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon, but I can’t bring that up yet, it’ll just be rejected outright.)|||Deskslam Hold Neutral
(That checks out with what Scootaloo said yesterday. How Turning Page offered to carry it for her, just in case.)|||Thinking Hold
(Rrrgh! At some point here, I need to counter with how the sword REALLY broke, but I’m still missing the evidence to support Turning’s version of events…) |||
(One way or another, I’m going to have to find it soon.)|||Deskslam Hold Neutral
You just stood on the path and waited?|||Deskslam Hold Neutral
How long were you waiting for them?|||Deskslam Hold Neutral
And you just stood there, taking care of plants the whole time? Weren’t you worried about two kids going so far into the forest by themselves?|||Thinking
I guess no one ever came, then?|||Thinking

Uhhh… |||Despair
(Yeah, sure. I’ll get right on it with the whole lotta NOTHING I can even say!) |||Despair
(No! I can’t let this happen! If I let this testimony stand, I’ll never be able to recover from it!)|||Deskslam Hold Exhausted
Wait! Hold on! There’s… There’s something about the witness’s testimony that I find strange.|||Deskslam Hold Sad
O-O-Of course it isn’t, Y-Your Honor!|||Despair
It totally is.|||Despair
Shut up, Widget!|||Despair
(Grrr… Don’t let them distract you, Athena! If Twilight doesn’t want to help me, then I’ll just have to figure this out by myself!) |||Deskslam Hold Angry
(But… there aren’t any contradictions or flaws! What now?)|||
(What would Mr. Wright do here? He’d turn his thinking around - think outside of the box!)|||Deskslam Hold Exhausted
(If I can’t cast doubt on the testimony itself, then… What if I just cast doubt on the one testifying? Is there a way to do that…?)|||
Y-Yes, Your Honor.|||Despair
(Here goes nothing…) |||Despair
So… a-actually, the previous testimony didn’t have any noticeable contradictions in it.|||Idle Neutral
Y-Yes, but, um… Well, what if we think about this another way?|||Idle Sad
According to the testimony, Zecora saw Scootaloo and Turning Page heading towards the crime scene. She heard a noise, and headed there herself. |||Thinking
On the way, she came across the two running away from the scene, and shortly afterwards, she arrived on the site.|||Idle Neutral
Well, let’s think about that last point for a minute. As we established earlier, the victim suffered both a blow to the side, and a stab to the head. |||Idle Neutral
What’s more, we know for a fact that, after the victim was knocked to the ground, he managed to get back up again.|||Idle Neutral
Right, but as was pointed out earlier, Scootaloo could not have been the one to inflict the fatal wound. |||Thinking
She can’t fly, so she wouldn’t have been able to stab Royal Order in the head after he stood up.|||Idle Neutral
(This is it. Now’s my chance! I may not personally believe what I’m about to say, but I don’t have a choice now. My hand’s been forced.) |||
But there WAS someone on the scene, actually. |||Idle Neutral
After Scootaloo and Turning Page fled, someone else arrived, and had the perfect opportunity to murder the victim.|||Deskslam Hold Sad
Let’s assume that Turning Page really did hit his father, and he fell to the ground. |||Idle Neutral
Now, at that point, who’s to say Scootaloo and Turning didn’t flee right then, without killing him?|||Thinking
Exactly. Given this scenario… |||Idle Neutral
It’s entirely possible that our witness, Ms. Zecora, is Royal Order’s true killer!|||Deskslam Hold Neutral
Not necessarily everything. Just the part where she claimed to have stumbled across the dead body. |||Thinking
The defense believes that instead of finding Royal Order dead, Zecora came across him as he was getting up. |||Idle Neutral
She then took the scooter that was left on the scene, and stabbed him in the head. |||Idle Neutral
Afterwards, she reported the body to the police, claiming he was already dead when she found him.|||Deskslam Hold Neutral
Turning and Scootaloo don’t have motives either. Is it really that much of a stretch to suspect you, as well?|||Deskslam Hold Neutral
Your Honor, I may not have any evidence to back up this claim, but you can’t deny it IS a possibility. |||Idle Neutral
As such, we shouldn’t take stock in ANY of this witness’s testimony!|||Deskslam Hold Neutral
?!|||Shock
Ch-Child?!|||Deskslam Angry
H-Hey! What gives?! I was just—!|||Indignant
Well, what else was I supposed to do?! That testimony-|||Indignant Hold
H-Huh?|||Indignant
B-But… That’s what you, and Your Honor, were assuming...|||Despair
