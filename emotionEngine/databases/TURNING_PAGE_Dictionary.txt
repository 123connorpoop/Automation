Good morning, everypony. Especially to you, Princess Twilight.|||Neutral Happy
What do you mean? Of course there is! You’re taking time out of your busy schedule to help defend Ms. Scootaloo and me! I’m eternally grateful, Princess! |||Neutral
O-oh. Uhh… well, it was… the prosecutor. They told us to be aware of your presence today.|||Scared
(Why does it always feel like we’re being left in the dark?) |||Neutral
(We don’t know anything about the prosecution, but somehow they already know about us? AND they told Turning and Scootaloo?)|||
Ms. Cykes? Princess Twilight?|||Neutral
I… have a request. I want you both to focus on Ms. Scootaloo. |||Neutral
I don’t care what happens to me, but… you MUST defend Scootaloo no matter what. |||Frustrated
She’s innocent! I know it! If worse comes to worse, let me take the blame, and just save her! |||Frustrated
I… I know that… |||Sad
But that’s a price I’m willing to pay, if it means Ms. Scootaloo is saved.|||Frustrated
(He’s… absolutely serious about this.)|||Frustrated
Defend me if you must, but just know that if I think things start to look bad… I won’t hesitate to confess if it means saving her.|||Neutral
Ungh… |||Scared
She’ll… she’ll be fine. Besides, she’d understand. |||Neutral
Sometimes, sacrifices need to be made. |||Neutral
It’s my duty, as a future member of the Royal Guard. If even one life is spared, no matter whose, I’d have no regrets.|||Neutral
Don’t worry, Scootaloo. If what the prosecutor said is true, then we shouldn’t have to worry at all. |||Neutral Happy
I’m just stating this as a last resort, in case things don’t go according to plan.|||Neutral
I’m sorry, Ms. Cykes, but we were told not to tell you anything about the prosecutor’s identity or plan.|||Neutral
S-Seriously?!|||Neutral
