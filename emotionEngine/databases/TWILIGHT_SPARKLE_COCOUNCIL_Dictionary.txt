Princess Twilight, if you know of any other sights I could catch in Equestria, I’d greatly appreciate being told about them.|||Scared
I’ll… let you know, Your Honor.|||Scared
Wait, PRINCESS CELESTIA asked you? Why?|||Scared
(That name, though… it sounds familiar… Wait!)|||straight to the point
It was where Equestria’s current rulers - Princesses Celestia and Luna - used to live.|||straight to the point
Twilight? What’s wrong?|||Shocked Anticipated
P-Princess Luna!? What are YOU doing here!?|||Scared
Heard? I think it’s more likely that you found out during your nightly stroll, am I right?|||Thinking
...|||Sad Anticipated
(What the heck are they talking about?)|||Sad Anticipated
...|||Sad
(Twilight…)|||Sad
…|||Sad
Twilight?|||Sad
Huh? Oh… sorry. Right, let’s get this started.|||Turned,Scared
…|||Turned, Happy
Well, not so fast, Prosecutor Luna.|||Neutral (that should've FUCKING EXISTED DAY 1)
Twilight?|||Neutral (that should've FUCKING EXISTED DAY 1)
The victim was a unicorn, wasn’t he? Did he, by any chance, know how to teleport?|||Thinking
!!! |||Thinking
(That’s right! I have to keep in mind that this is a world of magic. Not everything here follows the rules of my own world.)|||Thinking
So, if he could teleport, then the time it would’ve taken the victim to travel between locations is irrelevant, wouldn’t you say?|||Thinking
Twilight, any ideas?|||Thinking
Unfortunately, none. I didn’t think this line of questioning was necessarily going to reveal anything case-breaking, but still… |||Thinking
Knowing that the victim had a half-hour period where he could act freely, without heading to the crime scene… |||Breathing Exercise
I think that might be something we’ll want to keep in mind.|||Neutral (that should've FUCKING EXISTED DAY 1)
I agree. It might not be relevant, but you never know.|||Neutral (that should've FUCKING EXISTED DAY 1)
