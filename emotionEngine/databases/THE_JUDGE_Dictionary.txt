Court is now in session for the trial of Scootaloo and Turning Page. Are the prosecution and defense ready?|||Idle
Prosecution! Defense! Are you ready?!|||Stern
Oh ho ho! You didn’t think I’d go straight back home, did you? I figured I’d just take a short vacation in this wonderful world!|||Laughing
I truly do love it here in Equestria! After I’m done with today’s trial, I plan on doing some sightseeing for a few days before I head back home.|||Thinking
I know I said I wasn’t interested before, but I’m thinking of checking out that race Prince Blueblood mentioned. |||Thinking
Well, actually, it was Princess Celestia who asked me to preside over this trial.|||Shock
I’m sorry, Ms. Sparkle, but I’m afraid I don’t have that answer. |||Thinking
The letter I received simply asked if I would be willing to preside over the trial, and I agreed.|||Thinking
In any case, we should get started with the trial. Prosecution, I have still yet to hear your answer. Are you ready?|||Idle
Hmmm… If the prosecution is not prepared, then it would appear that I will have to postpone the trial until they arrive.|||Stern
Very well… Court is—|||Thinking
Oh? And who might you be?|||Shock Idle
Ah, yes, I do recall receiving a message that the original prosecutor for this case chose to allocate their duties to another.|||Idle
Regardless, that is no excuse to be late to court, prosecu— erm, Princess.|||Idle
Hmm, very well.|||Thinking
And with that, let us resume this trial. Prosecutor Luna, you may make your opening statement.|||Idle
The court accepts the report as evidence.|||Idle
A single lethal strike, then… |||Thinking
Hmm, I see.|||Thinking
There’s still one more point in this autopsy report that confuses me, though.|||Idle
That’s correct. This… poison joke. I’ve done my research on Equestria, but I’m afraid my studies didn’t quite cover this topic.|||Idle
Hmm, indeed.|||Thinking
Very well. The court accepts the diagrams and photo as evidence.|||Idle
It is rather difficult for me to believe that these two children would do something like this, though. |||Stern
Not to mention the fact that one of the two standing accused is the victim's own son!|||Shock
Hmmm... You’d better have some pretty substantial evidence to back up your claims, Prosecutor Luna. These are children’s lives at stake.|||Thinking
Certainly, Prosecutor Luna. That is the duty of a judge, after all.|||Idle
Well then, defense, what is your stance regarding the charges filed against your clients?|||Idle
The court acknowledges the defense’s position. Now then, let’s hear from the prosecution’s first witness.|||Idle
Very well.|||Idle
Lord, huh? Hmm… I could get used to that.|||Thinking
I see. You’d certainly need a very good reason to be willing to head that far into the forest. |||Thinking
If I recall correctly, that place is filled with all kinds of dangerous creatures, isn’t it?|||Shock
Ms.… Devotion?|||Shock
Hmm, she certainly sounds like a very kind, hard-working mare.|||Thinking
Now, Ms. Cykes, you may begin your cross-examination.|||Idle
Defense, please stop staring at the witness, and continue your cross-examination!|||Stern
Hmm, this fellow seemed like quite the workaholic.|||Thinking
And what did the victim do once he got there?|||Idle
Oooh, that sounds rather ominous. Like something right out of a horror movie.|||Shock
Ms. Cykes! Ms. Sparkle! If you are done whispering over there, then let’s continue with the testimony!|||Stern
That certainly seems to make sense. And what weapon are you proposing was used to knock the victim down?|||Idle
One of the defendants… HAS A SWORD?!|||Idle
One of the defendants… HAS A SWORD?!|||Shock
I see. That’s definitely a strong possibility.|||Idle
Oh?|||Shock Idle
The court agrees with the prosecution.|||Idle
So I assume that this sword of the defendant’s was also used to stab the victim?|||Idle
But then… What WAS used to stab the victim?|||Idle
A… A scooter?!|||Shock
A… A scooter?!|||Shock Idle
How… How is that even possible?! Scooters aren’t sharp… are they?|||Shock
Broken… how?|||Idle
WHAT?!|||Shock
WHAT?!|||Shock Idle
Order! Order, I say! |||Stern
Hmm... I must admit, as unbelievable as it appeared to be at first, the more I listen, the more it seems like these two kids really DID commit this crime.|||Thinking
Hmm, yes. That does seem to be what happened, given the evidence so far.|||Thinking
Very well. Detective, if you please.|||Idle
It does say that, yes, but… I fail to see how this contradicts the witness’s testimony.|||Idle
Hmm, well, that would be… the left side, wouldn’t it?|||Thinking
OH!|||Shock
ORDER! Order! That's certainly a puzzling contradiction! |||Stern
The victim COULDN’T possibly have been stabbed in the right temple if he were in that position. |||Idle
Prosecutor Luna, any thoughts?|||Stern
Well, Ms. Cykes? Is what the prosecution said true? Are you claiming that the victim was first stabbed, and then struck?|||Stern
Y-You aren’t?|||Shock
Prosecutor Luna, do you have an explanation for this seemingly unexplainable contradiction!?|||Stern
You can explain it? Then please, share your theory with the court!|||Shock
The victim… fell onto the murder weapon?|||Idle
Hmm, indeed. This murder could very well have been an accident, in that case!|||Thinking
But then, wouldn’t the object that took the victim’s life still be at the scene? You would’ve found it there, wouldn’t you?|||Idle
And what about the blood on the scooter?|||Idle
I see…! Which would mean the culprit is...|||Thinking
If that’s the case, then everything would line up, wouldn’t it?|||Stern
Ms. Cykes! If you are done whispering to your co-counsel, then tell us! |||Stern
Do you intend to argue that this murder was, in fact, an accident?|||Stern
Y-You don’t!?|||Shock Idle
Order! Order in the court!|||Stern
After hearing both the prosecution and defense’s claims, I believe I must side with the prosecution’s stance.|||Thinking
Your theory of the body being moved, while plausible, simply lacks enough evidence to back it up, and leaves too many questions unanswered. |||Idle
If the body was moved, who moved it, why, and from where?|||Thinking
Oh! Why, thank you, Ms. Cykes. I have been doing this for quite some time, you know.|||Shock Idle
Then please, show it to us, Ms. Cykes.|||Idle
A contradiction? Where?|||Idle
Yes, there should be…|||Thinking
Hmm… |||Thinking
There’s… There’s no blood at all!!!|||Shock Idle
There’s… There’s no blood at all!!!|||Shock
Indeed it does, Ms. Cykes.|||Idle
Very well. Detective, you may leave the stand. But please remain in the courtroom. We may need your opinion on other matters as they come up.|||Idle
Now then, let the prosecution’s next witness take the stand!|||Idle
You live in the Everfree Forest?|||Shock
And you say you’re an… apothecary?|||Idle
Interesting.|||Thinking
Then please, give us your testimony in relation to this... gruesome discovery.|||Idle
