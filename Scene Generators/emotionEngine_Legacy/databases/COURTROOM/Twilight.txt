Princess Twilight, if you know of any other sights I could catch in Equestria, I’d greatly appreciate being told about them.|||Scared
I’ll… let you know, Your Honor.|||Scared
Wait, PRINCESS CELESTIA asked you? Why?|||Scared
(That name, though… it sounds familiar… Wait!)|||straight to the point
It was where Equestria’s current rulers - Princesses Celestia and Luna - used to live.|||straight to the point
Twilight? What’s wrong?|||Shocked Anticipated
P-Princess Luna!? What are YOU doing here!?|||Scared
Heard? I think it’s more likely that you found out during your nightly stroll, am I right?|||Thinking
...|||Sad Anticipated
(What the heck are they talking about?)|||Sad Anticipated
...|||Sad
(Twilight…)|||Sad
…|||Sad
Twilight?|||Sad
Huh? Oh… sorry. Right, let’s get this started.|||Turned,Scared
…|||Turned, Happy
Well, not so fast, Prosecutor Luna.|||Neutral (that should've FUCKING EXISTED DAY 1)
Twilight?|||Neutral (that should've FUCKING EXISTED DAY 1)
The victim was a unicorn, wasn’t he? Did he, by any chance, know how to teleport?|||Thinking
!!! |||Thinking
(That’s right! I have to keep in mind that this is a world of magic. Not everything here follows the rules of my own world.)|||Thinking
So, if he could teleport, then the time it would’ve taken the victim to travel between locations is irrelevant, wouldn’t you say?|||Thinking
Twilight, any ideas?|||Thinking
Unfortunately, none. I didn’t think this line of questioning was necessarily going to reveal anything case-breaking, but still… |||Thinking
Knowing that the victim had a half-hour period where he could act freely, without heading to the crime scene… |||Breathing Exercise
I think that might be something we’ll want to keep in mind.|||Neutral (that should've FUCKING EXISTED DAY 1)
I agree. It might not be relevant, but you never know.|||Neutral (that should've FUCKING EXISTED DAY 1)
Don’t doubt yourself, Athena.|||Breathing Exercise
Twilight?|||Breathing Exercise
If you think there’s a contradiction, then go for it. I’ll be right here with you.|||Turned, Happy
Right. Thanks, Twilight! |||Turned, Happy
That can’t be it, Athena. Think back to the autopsy report one more time.|||Thinking
Ah! You’re right, Twilight!|||Thinking
Way to go, Athena!|||Turned, Happy
Let’s see how the Princess tries to get out of this one.|||Turned, Happy
Athena?|||Turned, Concerned
I’m… not sure what to do here, Twilight. The way things are going, I could very easily get Scootaloo off the hook, and Turning a light prison sentence. |||Turned, Concerned
Hmm, that WOULD have everything turn out just as Turning asked back in the defendant lobby.|||Thinking
But, I don’t think I should do that.|||Thinking
...|||Breathing Exercise
If I do… That’ll just mean we’re admitting that Turning killed his own father, even if only by accident, and that will undoubtedly have a severe effect on him.|||Breathing Exercise
His family, his peers… They’d never look at him or treat him the same way again.|||Breathing Exercise
It’d ruin his life!|||Breathing Exercise
Even so, Turning seems to be satisfied with that.|||Neutral (that should've FUCKING EXISTED DAY 1)
Well, I’m not! I don’t care if he thinks it’d be a good thing to do, because it isn’t! |||Breathing Exercise
I’m supposed to look out for both his and Scootaloo’s best interests, and him taking the blame isn’t what she wants!  |||Breathing Exercise
So if Luna’s got some sort of trap waiting for me, bring it on! I’ll never admit that either of them had anything to do with Royal Order’s death!|||Breathing Exercise
…|||Breathing Exercise
If that’s the path you’re going down, then don’t you worry; I’ve got your back!|||Turned, Happy
Thank you, Twilight. |||Turned, Happy
Oh, right. I guess I forgot to mention that, didn’t I?|||Embarassed
You and Apple Bloom both…|||Embarassed
You mean… someone tried to clean up the crime scene?|||Scared
Princess Luna, if you choose to claim that, then Scootaloo would’ve done nothing wrong, am I right?|||Neutral (that should've FUCKING EXISTED DAY 1)
!!!|||Neutral (that should've FUCKING EXISTED DAY 1)
It’s simple, Your Honor. If Turning Page was the one who assaulted his father, and then proceeded to stab him in the head with the scooter... |||Neutral (that should've FUCKING EXISTED DAY 1)
...then Scootaloo would be completely innocent - nothing but a bystander at most. Am I right, Princess Luna?|||Angry Facing Forward
