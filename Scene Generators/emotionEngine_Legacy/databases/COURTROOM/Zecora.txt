My name is Zecora, an apothecary. I make my home in the Everfree.|||Neutral Happy
Yes, Your Honor, I am indeed. Crafting potions is my creed. The forest's creatures are bizarre, but their wonders are unmatched, by far.|||Neutral Happy
Yes, quite sadly, this is true. It was a scene most gruesome, too.|||Sad
Of course, Your Honor, I shall speak. I’m sorry, for this tale is bleak.|||Neutral
That evening, I was tending to the plants near my home.|||Neutral Happy
Two little ponies passed, heading towards the castle dome.|||Neutral Happy
For a while I waited, but return they did not, so I chose to head home at an agile trot.|||Contemplating
But soon I heard a strange, far-off sound. I ran to where those ponies were bound.|||Contemplating
On my way, a small shadow my eyes did track. But it jumped away before I could react.|||Neutral
Upon arrival, what met my gaze I’ll not forget for all my days. |||Neutral
A pony’s body, still, with blood around his head, turning earth to mud.|||Sad
Once I was sure that he was dead, to the police I quickly fled.|||Neutral
Most creatures are clean with the food they hunt. But a corpse in the open? A surprise, to be blunt.|||Neutral
Of all the life that he had bled, a ring of red lay around his head.|||Contemplating
Do not point your rage at me. I have told you all I've seen.|||Anger

That evening, I was tending to the plants near my home.|||Neutral Happy
Yes, my plants must grow up strong, lest a potion turn out wrong.|||Neutral Happy
Yes, they’re blooming but not quite grown, since only recently they were sown.|||Neutral Happy
Many flowers around my home can’t grow without the forest’s loam. They’re so rare that to meet my needs, I search the forest for their seeds. |||Contemplating
I tend to them both day and night, and harvest them when the time is right. |||Presenting
But poison joke differs, it's often seen in a sprawl. But at this time of year, it hardly grows at all.|||Neutral
I searched quite long that day. From dawn to dusk, I was away. When I got home with the seeds I sought, I tended to my garden plot.|||Contemplating
Yes, for along that castle’s cliffside, sometimes rare flowers peek and hide. Sadly when my search was done, I left without finding a single one.|||Neutral
I understand what you mean to say. But no, the body wasn’t there that day.|||Sad
Two little ponies passed, heading towards the castle dome.|||Neutral Happy
Of the colt I had no clue, but the filly was Miss Scootaloo.|||Contemplating
It surely was a curious sight: two foals traveling solo that night. The forest’s danger is well-known, so I thought, “What are they doing alone?”|||Neutral
Scootaloo looked frightened, but that wasn't so strange. The forest scares anypony of any age. |||Neutral
The colt was holding something thick, not with his hooves, but with magic.|||Contemplating
It was a bolt of fabric, rolled. The moonlight showed that it was gold.|||Contemplating
He also carried a weapon, a sword of solid wood. Given where they were going, I thought this was good.|||Neutral
Indeed, there wasn’t a single crack. The sword appeared fully intact.|||Neutral Happy
For a while I waited, but return they did not, so I chose to head home at an agile trot.|||Contemplating
It would not have done to stand and wait, for time has an unchanging gait. |||Neutral
Along the central path nearby some plants were quite nearly bone dry. These I tended by the light of the moon, expecting the foals to come back soon.|||Contemplating
I worked from 9:45 to about 10:10, so a half-hour had nearly passed by then.|||Neutral
Of course I was - who wouldn't be? After all, they were in the Everfree. |||Anger
Of course I was - who wouldn't be? After all, they were in the Everfree. |||Anger
But for all that time there was no sound, nor any sign that they were found. On the path I kept one eye, in case they returned, or another passed by.|||Neutral

(If I can’t cast doubt on the testimony itself, then… What if I just cast doubt on the one testifying? Is there a way to do that…?)|||Neutral
Wh-WHAT?!|||Neutral Happy/Shocked
Wh-WHAT?!|||Shocked
That… That is a RIDICULOUS accusation! What could possibly be my motivation?!|||Shocked
