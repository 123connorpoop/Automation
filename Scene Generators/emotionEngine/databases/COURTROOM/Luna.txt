I am Princess Luna. A pleasure to meet you, Your Honor.|||Neutral Happying
Just “Prosecutor” will do, Your Honor, and I understand. My sincerest apologies.|||Neutral Happying
A colleague of mine had something they wished to discuss with me, and so it delayed my arrival. Nevertheless, the prosecution is now prepared.|||Neutraling
Ah, Twilight Sparkle. I heard that you would be assisting the defense today.|||Neutral Happying
Heh, I should’ve expected you’d know. You’ve always been the clever one.|||Neutral Happying
Nevertheless, Ms. Sparkle, the reason I’m here is quite simple: it is my duty to uphold the laws of Equestria. I am simply fulfilling that duty. |||N_Eyes Closed -ing
Regardless of whom it is I may be prosecuting, be they adult or child, friend or foe, I plan to fulfill my responsibility to the fullest.|||Neutraling
But of course, being the clever pony that you are, I’m sure you could’ve guessed that, couldn’t you?|||Condescendinging
As for you, defense.|||Neutraling
I must confess, I WAS hoping that the Blue Phoenix would stand against me.|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
His efforts during the TS-5 case, and the case from two days ago, were certainly admirable, twice proving there WAS no murder in our peaceful country.|||Neutral Happying
So, imagine my surprise when I learned that YOU would be the lead on this case instead. |||Neutral Happying
You, whom I have only heard of in hearsay and whispers that began spreading after the trial in Manehattan.|||Condescendinging
I look forward to seeing if you can hold yourself up to the same standards that the Blue Phoenix has set.|||Condescendinging
Is that so? Well, that’s wonderful to hear.|||Condescendinging
At once, Your Honor.|||Neutral Happying
Today’s proceedings shall center around the murder of Royal Order, who had just returned home from Canterlot the night he was killed. |||Neutraling
He was a member of the Royal Guard.|||Neutraling
Rest assured, my little ponies, that there is no cause for alarm. We anticipated this would be the public’s reaction to this news. |||Desk Slam Neutral
That is why we withheld this information until we had all the facts.|||Neutraling
Now that we have investigated this matter in full, we are ready to present the truth behind this stallion’s death to the court, and the public. |||Neutraling
I will begin by submitting the victim’s autopsy report.|||Neutraling
The time of death is estimated to be on the evening of February 12th, between 9:30pm, when the victim was last seen, and 10:30pm, when the body was discovered. |||Reading Scroll
The coroner was able to confirm this during their examination of the body.|||Neutraling
Death came as the result of a single stab wound to the right side of the victim’s head.|||Reading Scroll
It’s not quite that simple, Your Honor. There was only ONE visible wound, but he appears to have been stabbed at least twice. |||N_Eyes Closed -ing
Whether or not this was caused by a single weapon or multiple weapons is unclear. |||Neutraling
What we DO know for certain is that the victim died instantly after just a single stab. All subsequent stabs the victim suffered were post-mortem.|||Reading Scroll
Additionally, we discovered a large bruise on the left side of the victim’s torso, indicating that he was struck by some sort of object. |||Reading Scroll
However, unlike the subsequent stab wounds, the victim received this bruise BEFORE he died.|||
I assume you are referring to the affliction the victim was suffering?|||Neutral Happying
There’s no need to worry, Your Honor. I shall explain. Poison joke is a rare type of flower, native only to the Everfree Forest.|||Neutral Happying
It is relatively harmless, but should one so much as touch the plant, they will be afflicted with a bizarre condition, unique to every individual.|||Neutraling
In the case of Royal Order, the affliction he suffered was weak knees. |||Reading Scroll
Ironic, that a member of the royal guard would be afflicted with a condition that makes it difficult to stand tall.|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
As for the body itself, it was discovered at the foot of the bridge leading to the Castle of the Two Sisters. |||Neutraling
As you can see on this diagram, the castle ruins lie at the very end of the path that cuts through the Everfree Forest.|||Neutraling
Lastly, the prosecution wishes to submit this photo of the crime scene to the court. |||Neutraling
The victim’s body had already been removed for autopsy by the time it was taken, but we laid out tape to mark its exact positioning.|||Neutraling
The ponies accused of committing this wretched crime are Turning Page, the son of the victim, and Scootaloo, a friend of Turning’s.|||Neutraling
It’s certainly a rather tough pill to swallow, but I am certain that, in time, you will come to see that these two were the only ones capable of committing this crime.|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
Trust me, Your Honor, it brings me no pleasure to prosecute these young souls. However, justice must still be served. |||Sad
In the eyes of the law, everypony is equal. “Age” is a non-issue. I trust that you, too, know this, and will remain impartial in your judgement?|||Sad Eyes Forward
I am glad to hear that, Your Honor.|||Neutral Happying
…|||Sad
Your Honor, the prosecution would like to call the detective in charge of this investigation, Private Eye, to the stand.|||Neutral Happying
Witness, please state your name and occupation for the record.|||Neutral Happying
The prosecution’s first course of action will be to make the actions of the victim clear to the court.|||Neutral Happying
Detective, please testify in regards to this matter.|||Neutral Happying
Our investigation determined that Turning Page had gone off into the forest with Scootaloo that night for currently unknown reasons. |||Neutraling
We believe this is why the victim was in the forest that night...|||Neutraling
...he was trying to save his son.|||Sad talk
It is indeed, Your Honor. Figuring out why the victim chose to go so far into the forest was one of the key questions we had during our investigation. |||Neutral Happying
It was the statement of one Ms. Devotion that cleared the matter up for us.|||Reading Scroll
…|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
It’s just as Detective Eye says. |||Neutraling
As someone who gave the victim his orders, I can say with certainty that there was nothing that set him apart from the other guards in our entourage.|||Neutraling
If you’re looking for a motive, defense, I’m sorry to say that you will not find it here.|||Condescendinging
Royal Order often spent many weeks in Canterlot with little time to himself. |||Neutraling
Even when offered extended sabbaticals, he chose to forgo them in service to the crown.|||Neutraling
He was simply honor-bound to serving Equestria and maintaining harmony amongst its citizens.|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
Whenever he wasn’t on active duty, he spent all of his time with his family in Ponyville.|||Neutraling
The forest entrance is roughly 20 minutes away from the victim’s house. |||Neutraling
The crime scene is about 35 minutes away from the entrance. The body was discovered at 10:30pm.|||Neutraling
Do the math, attorney. Do you really think the victim could’ve dawdled before entering the forest?|||Skeptical
What is it, Ms. Sparkle?|||Neutraling
Detective. Do you have the answer to Princess Twilight’s question?|||
You have a point, but, as I’m sure one as proficient in magic as yourself is aware, one cannot teleport to locations that they’ve never been.|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
We could not find any indication that the victim had ever been to the Castle of the Two Sisters before this incident. |||N_Eyes Closed -ing
The best we could uncover were multiple instances of him and his son going to Froggy Bottom Bog, to spar with the monsters that inhabit the area.|||Neutraling
I suppose that’s a reasonable assumption to make. Then, are you saying that between 9:30 and 10:00, the victim was off doing something else?|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
Why? |||Skeptical
His son had gone off into the Everfree Forest alone at night. |||Skeptical
Do you really think he’d waste time delaying his entrance into the forest? |||Skeptical
If anything, he would’ve used the extra half-hour he had to search elsewhere in the woods. After all, it’s not like he could’ve known exactly where his son was.|||Skeptical
A wooden one, Your Honor. No need to worry. I have it right here.|||Neutraling
The defendant has been known to carry this sword everywhere he goes. That night was no different.|||Neutraling
According to our witness, when she last saw the defendant, his sword was still in one piece, yet the sword you see now is broken. |||Reading Scroll
Turning Page’s mother has also confirmed that his sword was undamaged earlier that day. |||Neutraling
The prosecution contends that the sword broke when it was used to attack the victim.|||Skeptical
Before you explain it to us, defense, I would like you to tell us from where you learned this alternate interpretation.|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
From the defendant himself, in other words? Do you truly believe that story to be reliable, in that case?|||Skeptical
Unless you have some proof to back up his story, I think you’d do well to keep it to yourself for now.|||Condescendinging
In any case, the prosecution recognizes that our own evidence on the matter is circumstantial. More definitive evidence may yet prove our claim to be false.|||
At the moment, however, this interpretation of the facts surrounding the sword is the most likely scenario.|||Skeptical
It was not, Your Honor. There wasn’t a single trace of blood on the sword. No forensic spell or potion could reveal even a single drop.|||
It was a possession belonging to the other defendant: Ms. Scootaloo. She stabbed him using her scooter.|||Desk Slam Neutral
You can see it in the photo I submitted earlier, Your Honor. |||Neutraling
When tested, we discovered that the blood was indeed the victim’s.|||Skeptical
...|||Sad
Yes, enlighten us, defense. What is this supposed contradiction?|||Condescendinging
Hmph. You certainly pose an interesting dilemma, defense. |||Condescendinging
So, are you implying that the victim was first stabbed in the head, and THEN hit in the torso? |||Condescendinging
It would certainly help your case, if you were. |||Condescendinging
After all, a child would have a much more difficult time trying to stab a fully grown stallion in the head if he were standing up straight, even IF one of them was a unicorn.|||Condescendinging
Intriguing… And why not, defense?|||Condescendinging
Hmph.|||Condescendinging
Of course I do.|||Condescendinging
At once, Your Honor. |||Neutral Happying
As the defense has so eagerly demonstrated for us, the victim’s autopsy report creates quite a few perplexing contradictions. |||Skeptical talk
However, there are two explanations that can clear them all up.|||Condescendinging
The first is a rather simple one. |||Neutraling
After the victim was struck, he fell onto something sharp, and it pierced his head, killing him.|||Desk slam normal talk
Well, it may not be right to call it a “murder” weapon. |||sad talk right
After all, there’s no proof to indicate that the assailant ever intended on killing the victim, should this be the case.|||Skeptical talk
And the crime scene WAS a forest, after all. Who knows what could be on the ground? All kinds of dangerous objects, I’m sure.|||Desk slam normal talk
Not if the culprit took it away in a panic, or in fear.|||Neutraling
That could’ve been the result of our real culprit wishing to frame Ms. Scootaloo for the crime. |||Desk slam normal talk
Even if it was an accident, the culprit still wouldn’t want to be caught. They would likely fabricate a weapon to avoid their punishment.|||Skeptical talk
In truth, while the stab wound in question IS quite similar in shape to the exposed bolt on the scooter...|||Skeptical talk
Irregularities WERE discovered during examination, which indicates that it’s possible two different items could’ve stabbed the victim.|||Desk slam normal talk
Indeed, Your Honor. The evidence, as it stands, suggests that Turning Page was the one who knocked the victim over. |||Neutraling
On top of that, out of the two defendants, he’s the only one who would benefit from making a fake weapon out of the scooter.|||Skeptical talk
What do YOU think, defense? |||Condescendinging
Do you wish to argue that this was all an accident, perpetrated by Turning Page alone?|||Condescendinging
Undoubtedly, the victim was knocked over after he was hit, but who’s to say that’s also when he died?|||attention talk
Yes, I do. The victim was NOT stabbed when he was knocked to the ground. |||attention talk
Instead, after he was knocked over, he managed to stand himself back up. |||attention talk
After an unspecified amount of time, he was then stabbed in the RIGHT temple, which caused him to fall over onto his LEFT side!|||attention talk
If you wish to pursue the theory of the body having been moved, you’ll need to first disprove that he was killed at the castle ruins. |||attention talk
All of the evidence presented in the trial so far points towards the likelihood of the murder occurring there. |||attention talk
Furthermore, nothing was missing from the crime scene to suggest that the murder may have occurred elsewhere. Right, defense?|||attention talk
…|||N_eyes-closed - talk
Interesting claim, Golden Pixie. And you sounded so triumphant while making it, too...|||attention talk
It's a shame that it’s completely flawed.|||N_eyes-closed - talk
True, there doesn’t appear to be any blood on the scene right now, but once I bring my next witness to the stand, that tune of yours will surely change.|||N_eyes-closed - talk
Witness, please state your name and occupation for the record.|||
Let’s get back on topic, shall we? |||Neutral_talking
Witness, is it true that, on the night of the murder, you were the one who discovered and reported the victim’s body?|||attention talk
Perhaps I can shed some light on this matter.|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
Of course, Your Honor. I’d look rather silly if I didn’t. |||N_Eyes Closed -ing
As was just stated, this witness was the one who reported the body to the police. |||N_Eyes Closed -ing
She accompanied them to the crime scene, and they found it in exactly the same state as she just described - the victim lying in a pool of his own blood. |||Neutraling
I have here a photograph of that very scene.|||Skepticaling
That will become clear soon enough.|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
First, the prosecution would like to submit this evidence to the court, along with this photograph.|||Neutraling
It’s a cape, Your Honor. The emblem on it denotes it as belonging to the Cutie Mark Crusaders, the group of which the defendant, Scootaloo, is a member.|||Neutraling
As you can see in this earlier photograph, two more of these capes, as well as the fabric used to line their undersides, laid in this wagon attached to the scooter. |||Neutraling
It likely goes without saying, but this wagon also belongs to Scootaloo.|||Skepticaling
We’ll cover that in a moment. For now, I would like to draw further attention to this cape here. |||N_Eyes Closed -ing
Upon testing it, we found that it was absolutely drenched in the victim’s blood.|||Neutraling
I can’t imagine that to be the case. Going by where this cape was found, I’d say there’s another, more likely possibility.|||Neutraling
This cape was discovered underneath the victim’s body. Specifically…|||Desk Slam Neutraling
…under his head.|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
It appears as though the little Golden Pixie has figured it out. |||Condescendinging
When the police went to examine the blood, they discovered that it wasn’t blood at all. It was actually…|||Reading Scrolling
…this cape right here!|||Skepticaling
…this cape right here!|||Skepticaling
Now do you understand, defense?|||Condescendinging
When the victim fell to the ground after being stabbed, he must have fallen on top of this cape. |||Skepticaling
Any blood that seeped from his wound would’ve trailed down his face and been absorbed by the cloth. |||Neutraling
When the witness came across it, she mistook the cape for blood due to its red color. |||Skepticaling
The fact that there was no blood at the scene is completely irrelevant. After all, it was the police themselves who removed it!|||Desk Slam Neutraling
Indeed it has, Your Honor. Despite what they claimed, it’s clear that the body was never moved. |||N_Eyes Closed -ing
The scene of the crime was undoubtedly at the foot of the bridge. The blood on this cape proves it. |||N_Eyes Closed -ing
And, as luck would have it, I have one more piece of information that will crush the defense’s rebuttal once and for all.|||Neutraling
Upon examining the area where the cape lay, thanks to forensic spell-testing, we discovered traces of blood...|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
 ...UNDERNEATH the area around the victim’s head.|||Skepticaling
It seems as if the cape absorbed more blood than it could handle, and some of it leaked through to the ground below.|||Neutraling
Further testing of this blood revealed that it belonged to the victim. |||Reading Scrolling
Your Honor, I submit to you the photo of the victim’s body, as well as the blood-stained cape, as evidence.|||
It seems the Golden Pixie has been rendered speechless in the face of such irrefutable evidence.|||Condescendinging
Feigning confidence will get you nowhere, defense.|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
You forget that the owner of that scooter is a pegasus. What’s stopping them from simply flying up and stabbing him that way?|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
…|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
Of course she couldn’t.|||Skepticaling
What the defense has said is absolutely true. I have the medical report from Scootaloo’s doctor right here. |||Neutraling
Contrary to other pegasus fillies her age, her wings haven’t fully developed yet, and thus, she cannot fly.|||Neutraling
Now, when did I ever claim that?|||Skepticaling
All I ever claimed was that SOMEPONY stabbed him whilst he was standing upright. |||Skepticaling
If it was impossible for Scootaloo to have done so, then that leaves only one option, doesn’t it?|||Neutraling
Turning Page is a talented unicorn for his age, and levitation is a relatively simple spell to learn, even for colts and fillies.|||Neutraling
I’m sure he’d have no problem levitating the scooter up to his father’s head, and stabbing him with it.|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
…|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
Heh. We shall see.|||Condescendinging
First, I think it’s time for the defense’s cross-examination of our witness. We’ve been putting that off for long enough now.|||Neutraling
We already know when the victim died. It was long after this witness was scouring the area for plants. |||Neutraling
Stop wasting our time with these pointless questions, and move on.|||Desk Slam Neutraling
Please continue, witness.|||Desk Slam Neutraling
Please continue, witness.|||Desk Slam Neutraling
These two ponies… Was there anything about them that caught your eye?|||Neutraling
And what was that?|||Neutraling
This matches what we found at the crime scene, as there was a roll of golden silk left behind in the wagon.|||Reading Scrolling
And I’m assuming this sword was in one piece, am I right?|||Neutraling
And it then broke when he used it to attack the victim.|||Skepticaling
We already know when the victim died. It was long after this witness was scouring the area for plants. |||Neutraling

Agreed, Your Honor. I don’t think our Golden Pixie can take much more. Best we put her out of her misery now.|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
Unless you two are interested in sharing with the court what you are squabbling about, I believe it is time we moved on.|||Skepticaling
Oh? Really, now? Please, do tell.|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
Talking to yourself, are we?|||Condescendinging
Another way?|||Neutraling
And right there, she found the dead body of one Royal Order. I see no point in us repeating all of this.|||Neutraling
Quite so. Our current theory is that Turning Page was the one who hit him, using his sword. |||Neutraling
However, if he was killed right at that moment, the stab wound would be on the opposite side of his head. |||N_Eyes Closed -ing
Therefore, he must have had an opportunity to stand upright before being stabbed, and falling over again.|||Neutraling
Which leads us to the conclusion that it must have been Turning Page. |||N_Eyes Closed -ing
He used his magic to stab the victim with the scooter. There wasn’t anyone else on the scene who could’ve done it, after all.|||Neutraling
...|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
Defense…|||Desk Slam Neutral
You naive CHILD! |||Angrying #2
For one who knows not the weight of her words, I can’t think of a better comparison!|||Angrying #2

You intend to cast doubt on the witness in order to save your own clients. Yet, to do so, you accuse her of committing the crime herself.|||Angrying #2
Was not at all conclusive!|||Angrying #2
The witness never saw who the killer was! She didn’t even clearly see who was running away from the scene!|||Angrying #2
And it’s your job to point out why that assumption is flawed, and demand further evidence and testimony for the prosecution to support their case! |||Angrying #2
But instead of doing that, you have openly accused this witness! You have dirted not just her name, but, if you’re wrong, yours as well!|||Angrying #2

Shame on you all! Is this the kind of “harmony” Equestria seeks to share with the world?!|||Desk Slam Aggressive
Shame on you all! Is this the kind of “harmony” Equestria seeks to share with the world?!|||Desk Slam Aggressive
My apologies, Your Honor.|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
Very well. If that’s the path you choose, so be it. I wonder if your co-counsel feels the same way, though?|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
Nevertheless, you shan’t be relying on that theory for much longer. If I can’t convince you to simply abandon it...|||Neutraling
...then I’ll just force you to go against it.|||Deskslaming
You mentioned motive a minute ago, did you not? The motive that Scootaloo and Turning Page lack? |||Deskslaming
It’s about time we discussed that, don’t you think? So bring out that letter you received yesterday.|||Neutraling
The blackmail letter! I know you have it. Show it to the court! Now!|||Deskslaming
They should, Your Honor. |||Neutraling
All of these items were accounted for at the crime scene.|||Reading Scrolling
Read the letter yourself, and I’m sure you’ll figure it out.|||Skepticaling
Precisely, Your Honor. Now we finally know why the defendants were in the forest in the first place. They went to settle this deal with their blackmailer. |||Neutraling
Not exactly, Your Honor. The two had met for the first time earlier that day. They became quick friends over the course of an afternoon.|||Neutraling
During her interrogation, the defendant, Scootaloo, mentioned that she was backed into a corner when her friends decided against following the orders they were given. |||Neutraling
She decided, instead, to ask her newfound friend, Turning Page, to help her retrieve what had been taken. |||Skepticaling
The two conspired to break into, and steal from, Carousel Boutique in order to acquire the golden silk the blackmailer asked for.|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
After acquiring the fabric, they proceeded to enter the forest, and made their way to the scene where the blackmailer was waiting.|||Neutraling
Unfortunately, defense, that is not a wholly concrete possibility.|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
Could easily be a red herring by the author of the note. These fillies are not the only ones who are aware of that particular taunt.|||Skepticaling
After all, if these fillies are as infamous as you say they are, then anypony familiar with them would know that they are fond of the term “blank flank.” |||Neutraling
It’s hardly proof, defense. Suppose Your Honor began to refer to you as “Golden Pixie.” Would that make him me?|||Skepticaling
But now let us turn our attention to the letter itself.|||Skepticaling
I’m sure everyone can see that this note is written entirely in letters cut out from a magazine. |||Neutraling
As a result, it is impossible to perform any sort of writing analysis. However, that doesn’t mean we can’t prove who the author of this note is.|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
If we could find the magazines that these letters were cut-out from, it’d be a simple matter of matching the cuts on the letters to the holes in the magazines.|||N_Eyes Closed -ing
Are you sure about that? |||N_Eyes Closed -ing
I have here two magazines with several letters cut out from many different pages. |||Skepticaling
If the court would be so kind, I’d like to request some time for the police to analyze the letters on the note, and the empty spaces in the magazines. |||Desk Slam Neutraling
If we get a match, then we’ll know for a fact that the blackmail letter was written using these magazines.|||Desk Slam Neutraling
