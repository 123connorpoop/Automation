Sweet Apple Acres - Farmhouse - Kitchen

TWILIGHT
Apple Bloom’s right.

TWILIGHT
I know everypony is upset, but we need to focus on the case at hoof. Arguing like this is going to get us nowhere.

TWILIGHT
You shouldn’t put the blame on yourself, Athena. I took part in this as well.

TWILIGHT
None of us want to see a friend accused of a crime they didn’t commit. So I promise, we’ll also make sure that Sweetie Belle gets the acquittal she deserves.

TWILIGHT
And Athena by mine…!

TWILIGHT
We will prove her innocence together!

TWILIGHT
We won’t let you down, Rarity!

TWILIGHT
Well, we know that clones were involved.

TWILIGHT
Maybe it’ll help if we go over Royal Order’s movements that night? 

TWILIGHT
Everything that we know and need to know center around figuring out what he did and where he did them. 

TWILIGHT
How about when he first got home? We know that that was when he learned what Turning Page was doing from Fair Devotion. 

TWILIGHT
And we know what happened on the way there…

TWILIGHT
Exactly. We managed to establish that that was ONE of the Royal Order clones. 

TWILIGHT
The crash resulted in the scooter breaking and the left handlebar stabbing Royal Order’s head.

TWILIGHT
No. That stab wound must not have been fatal since, based on the blood trail, that that Royal Order managed to stand and head over to the Nightmare Night statue.

TWILIGHT
THAT was where he was killed. Impaled on the statue’s base, somehow. The timberwolves in the area then ate the body, and lapped up all the blood afterwards.

TWILIGHT
That’s… where we believe Sugar Stamp was involved. The imprint on the bottom of the wagon matches the badge on her mail bag. 

TWILIGHT
We think she transported the items from the crossroads…

TWILIGHT
Scootaloo and Turning Page might be there, too, so we should talk to them as well. Maybe we could even speak to Zecora, if she’s there.

TWILIGHT
There’s also the Everfree Forest. Now that we know that the clearing and crossroads were involved, we’ll need to investigate them thoroughly.

TWILIGHT
Applejack? What about you?

TWILIGHT
In which case, we’d better get going—

TWILIGHT
Just a sec. Spike, you don’t mind…

TWILIGHT
We’ll do our best, Spike! Okay, everyone. Let’s get going!
