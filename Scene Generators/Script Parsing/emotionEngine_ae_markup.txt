s1_001_royal order
[Shocked] Turning?!

s1_002_turning page
[Surprised] Dad? What are you doing here?

s1_003_royal order
[Concerned] We… we were looking for you. Are you all right? Are you hurt?

s1_004_turning page
Y-Yeah, I’m fine… what were you and Mom arguing about?

s1_005_royal order
[Questioning on 3rd sentence] You heard that? … Well, never you mind. Turning, what exactly are you doing in the Everfree Forest at this hour? Your mother and I were so worried!

s1_006_turning page
S-Sorry, Dad, but… it’s kinda a long story. 

s1_007_turning page
You see, a… very good friend of mine got into some trouble with these two fillies: Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon.

s1_008_royal order
Trouble? What kind of trouble?

s1_009_turning page
[Angry] They… They’d stolen some of her stuff. And they were blackmailing her so that she’d get them something they wanted in exchange! 

s1_010_turning page
They arranged to meet in the forest, by the castle ruins, to conduct the exchange. My friend came to me for help, and I agreed.

s1_011_turning page
So, I went with her, to make sure that she didn’t get hurt, and to make sure the deal went smoothly.

s1_012_royal order
[Surprised] You… came out here without an adult?

s1_013_turning page
Well, yeah! I couldn’t just let her go off on her own! Besides, I wanted to teach those blackmailers a lesson! 

s1_014_royal order
[Worried] A lesson…? 

s1_015_turning page
[Excited, satisfied] Right, a lesson. It’s like you’ve always taught me! Evildoers beware, or taste the might of my sword! I’d say those fillies got a good taste of it, all right!

[Turning levitates his broken sword in front of him, and Royal notes the damage.]

s1_016_royal order
Your sword… it’s broken.

s1_017_turning page
[Cheerfully] Yeah… I guess I swung it a little too hard. Oh, well! Nothing that a bit of duct tape won’t fix!

s1_018_royal order
(He could have seriously hurt somepony! And if he wasn’t careful with his swing, he might have hurt his friend… or even himself!)

s1_019_royal order
[Guilty] (This… This must be what Fair meant. His reckless behavior at home… Is it really my fault? Have I led him that far astray?)

s1_020_royal order
I’m afraid I still don’t quite fully understand, Turning. You still came out to a dangerous forest armed with nothing but that wooden sword.

s1_021_turning page
[Not understanding] Yeah, and? 

s1_022_royal order
What if you’d gotten attacked by something, like a wild animal? Or worse… what if your friend had?

s1_023_turning page
[Confident] Come on, Dad! That’s why I went with her in the first place! 

s1_024_turning page
Besides, I’m pretty sure I could take on anycreature in this forest! Your training has definitely proven that! HIYAH!

[Turning proudly swings his sword again.]

s1_025_turning page
[Excited] If nothing else, it would have proven a great way to test my skills! Hey! Maybe you could teach me a few new strikes that only a Royal Guard would know!

s1_026_royal order
My training…

s1_027_royal order
(Stars above… Fair was right. This IS my fault! How do I even begin to confront this issue?)

s1_028_royal order
[Tone of warning] Turning Page… 

[Turning, previously excited, notes the change in his father’s tone. He lowers his sword and looks at him, confused.]

s1_029_royal order
I… We need to talk about that, actually. Your… “training.”

s1_030_turning page
O-oh? Okay… Um, what about it?

s1_031_royal order
[Delicately] It’s just… maybe we should, you know… ease up on it for a bit. 

s1_032_turning page
Ease… up?

s1_033_royal order
Right… it’s just, well… I know you’re still enthusiastic about joining the Royal Guard, but… maybe now isn’t the best time.

s1_034_turning page
W-what? What do you mean?

s1_035_royal order
Look, son. There’s… there’s a lot going on in the world, right now. Crazy stuff. Dangerous stuff. 

s1_036_royal order
Even with your training… I’m just concerned about your safety, that’s all.

[Turning is silent, uncomprehending. Royal rushes on, attempting to explain himself.]

s1_037_royal order
[Delicately] A-and your mother and I, well, we think it might be better if you focus on something less risky. For the time being, of course!

s1_038_royal order
Though that WOULD mean you would have to attend school.

s1_039_turning page
[Shocked] W-What?!

s1_040_royal order
I understand that school is a bit of a sore topic for you, but you DO have to attend. 

s1_041_turning page
B-But what about joining the Royal Guard?!

s1_042_royal order
I’m not saying you can’t, just that… you should wait. Learn some patience. Be a little less reckless with yourself, show some forethought, that sort of thing.

s1_043_turning page
Are you saying I’m not ready?!

s1_044_royal order
[sigh] No, Turning Page, you aren’t. Not… not by a long shot.

s1_045_turning page
[Defensive] How can you say that?! I-I’m more than ready to join! I-I save ponies and hurt those who want to do bad things, like Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon and—

s1_046_royal order
But that’s my point, Turning Page. 

s1_047_royal order
You hurt them, yes, but don’t you know what that resulted in? Spoiled Rich demanding we pay for the damages you wrought!

s1_048_royal order
[Lecturing] Had you not been so reckless as to attack those fillies—

s1_049_turning page
But they DESERVED it—

s1_050_royal order
That’s not for either of us to say, Turning. And even if they DID, attacking them has only landed us in a truly dire situation.

s1_051_royal order
[Lecturing] You can’t be this reckless. Not if you want to join the Royal Guard… and certainly not for the rest of your life.

s1_052_turning page
!!

s1_053_royal order
That’s why I think it would be best if you DO start attending school. If nothing else, perhaps the social interaction will teach you how to keep a cool head. 

s1_054_turning page
[Even more worried and hurt] W-what… but… I… W-What about our sparring sessions? D-Does this mean we can’t have them anymore?

s1_055_royal order
[Distant] I… I’m afraid not. My job in Canterlot is… about to be even more demanding of my time. 

s1_056_royal order
[Second sentence slightly under breath] I probably won’t be able to come home all that often… much to your mother’s disappointment…

s1_057_turning page
[Outraged] Your job? B-but why? How does working in some stuffy place like Canterlot lead to more work for you?!

s1_058_royal order
… I’m sorry, Turning. I can’t tell you that.

s1_059_turning page
Nngk! 

s1_060_royal order
I know this comes as a great shock to you, son, but… 

s1_061_royal order
[Attempting to placate Turning] If you simply listen to your mother, and start attending school, everything will play out just fine. I promise. 

s1_062_turning page
I… I… 

[Turning begins to shake. Royal, concerned, approaches him.]

s1_063_royal order
Turning? Are… Are you all right—

s1_064_turning page
YYYEEEAAAAAGGHHH!

s1_065_turning page
[Breathing heavily]... ? H-Huh? W-what… what the…

s1_066_turning page
…D-Dad?

*END OF FLASHBACK*

s1_067_judge
 …

s1_068_judge
[Solemn] This has… left me truly speechless.

s1_069_luna
[Serious] This is a grave turn of events, Your Honor. I expect many of us are at a loss for words.

s1_070_athena
[Attempting to recover] Turning, you… You must have been in complete shock afterwards.

s1_071_turning page
I was. It just happened so fast. I couldn’t believe my eyes—I thought he would somehow be fine.

s1_072_twilight
It was the poison joke. He’d gotten infected while looking around Froggy Bottom Bog, and it took effect by the time you had confronted him. 

s1_073_turning page
Once I’d recovered enough, I levitated him down from the spike, to see if I could help him, but… 

s1_074_turning page
[Horrified] He just kept gushing blood. Everywhere. The statue, the ground… it was all covered. I wanted to scream, but my voice just wouldn’t come out.

s1_075_fair devotion
[Quietly] And that was when I came rushing back. 

[Fair momentarily composes herself, and when she looks at Athena and speaks, it’s almost with a bittersweet, begrudging tone.]

s1_076_fair devotion
[Bittersweet] Honestly, I’m impressed you managed to piece it together so thoroughly, Ms. Cykes. I DID run off after Royal Order and I fought… and I did come back afterwards.

s1_077_twilight
I’m guessing it was the clang that got you to turn back?

s1_078_fair devotion
[Solemn] That’s right. The clang… that came from Turning hitting his father with his sword.

*FLASHBACK RESUMES*

s1_079_fair devotion
[Confused] W-What the—Turning Page? What happened here?

s1_080_turning page
Mom, I… I… It was an accident, I swear, I just got so angry and—

s1_081_fair devotion
[gasp] R-Royal?! H-hang on, honey, j-just—

[But when Fair reaches his body, she realizes it’s too late.]

s1_082_fair devotion
[quietly, on the verge of panic] Oh, no. Oh, no no no, no… 

s1_083_turning page
M-Mom? I-is there anything we can do?

s1_084_fair devotion
[Quietly] … N-no. He’s… He’s already gone.

s1_085_turning page
[subdued] No…

[Silence descends upon the scene for but a moment. Then Turning squares himself up.]

s1_086_turning page
[Serious] I’ll do it.

s1_087_fair devotion
You’ll… what?

s1_088_turning page
Turn myself in. It’s my fault, after all, and… It’s the right thing to do.

s1_089_fair devotion
N-No!

[Turning is taken aback by her outburst.]

s1_090_fair devotion
[Desperate, trying to compose herself] Please, just… listen to me. I’m… I’m so grateful you’re alive, Turning. I was worried that… Well, I… You can’t turn yourself in!

s1_091_turning page
B-but Mom—

s1_092_fair devotion
Even if this was an accident, the police won’t care! They’ll treat it like a murder! 

s1_093_fair devotion
[Frantic] And you know what happens to murderers—they’re banished from Equestria, no matter who they are!

s1_094_fair devotion
Royal wouldn’t want that. He wanted you to become a member of the Royal Guard one day, not throw it all away because of… because of some accident!

s1_095_fair devotion
[Pleading] Please, Turning… I… I can’t bear to lose you, too.

s1_096_turning page
B-but, Mom… I did this. D-Don’t I have to pay for it?

[Fair begins to think.]

s1_097_fair devotion
… No, Turning. After all, you didn’t do this.

s1_098_turning page
Huh?

s1_099_fair devotion
[Coyly] It was… it was the result of an attack by some of the forest’s creatures. That’s what happened here. Nothing else. And here’s how we’ll make it so… 

*END OF FLASHBACK*

s1_100_athena
Hold up a second, Ms. Devotion. Before you continue, I’d like to ask Sugar Stamp something.

[Sugar Stamp appears.]

s1_101_athena
Sugar Stamp, the one thing you’ve been consistent on throughout this trial was that you saw the murder happen with your own eyes. 

s1_102_athena
Given what we now know, could you elaborate on that?

s1_103_sugar stamp
Y-yeah. I… I was in the forest that night delivering a letter to Zecora. I meant to fly to her hut right away, but… I heard a clang from somewhere in the woods.

s1_104_sugar stamp
When I went to investigate, I saw Turning remove his father’s body from the statue. 

s1_105_sugar stamp
I didn’t understand what had happened—not yet—but just as I was about to fly down and ask…

s1_106_sugar stamp
… That’s when Deva showed up.

s1_107_twilight
But you didn’t leave?

s1_108_sugar stamp
No, even though I thought I should. But… I couldn’t leave them. Turning looked so scared, and Deva… She looked so broken. 

s1_109_sugar stamp
I didn’t want to interfere with whatever conversation they were having, but I figured I could just… watch. 

s1_110_luna
And that must be when you overheard the witness’s plan. 

s1_111_sugar stamp
Yeah. It’s just as Fair had claimed before… but this time, Turning was the one complicit with it. 

s1_112_turning page
I didn’t want to go through with it, to be honest, but seeing Mom so upset, and remembering what my dad said to me before he…

[Turning trails off, but Athena figures out the rest for him.]

s1_113_athena
[Solemnly] (“If you simply listen to your mother… everything will play out just fine. I promise.”)

s1_114_turning page
Well, I decided that I couldn’t refuse. So… I did as she told me. 

s1_115_turning page
The first thing I did was move Dad’s body from the statue over to the crossroads, leaving the armor behind. Mom followed next to me.

s1_116_sugar stamp
[Concerned] While he did that, I kept watch, flying from tree to tree. The body… It kept leaking blood everywhere, leaving a trail behind them.

s1_117_turning page
We would have continued, but that was when we heard ANOTHER clang—coming from the statue.

s1_118_twilight
The second clang… The one that Sweetie Belle made in order to scare off the timberwolves.

s1_119_fair devotion
After we heard that, I told Turning to continue to Froggy Bottom Bog, then rushed back to the statue, afraid somepony had discovered the scene. 

s1_120_fair devotion
When I got to the statue, though, nopony was there. Only the armor and blood were. 

s1_121_athena
I see… And that’s when you must have moved the blood, as well as the armor, farther into the forest—to the clearing.

s1_122_twilight
All in order to suggest that timberwolves had attacked Royal Order and eaten his body.

s1_123_turning page
While Mom was doing that, though, I stopped at the crossroads. I was starting to have second thoughts. 

s1_124_turning page
I know Dad said I should listen to Mom, but still, lying? It… It felt horrible.

s1_125_turning page
But before I could come to a decision, I heard somepony coming. Thinking quickly, I ducked behind the body. And that…

s1_126_luna
… was when Scootaloo crashed into you.

s1_127_turning page
[Pained] Yeah. It took everything I had in me to avoid screaming. But I realized soon after who had hit me. 

s1_128_turning page
I tried to call out to her, but she was already running away, so I ran after her instead.

s1_129_sugar stamp
He’d left the body behind, and… that was when I decided to try and help out. I flew down to the scene to grab the body and move the scooter.

s1_130_athena
Move the scooter?

s1_131_sugar stamp
Yeah. I didn’t want Scootaloo to be blamed for Royal’s death, so I figured if I could move it, then deliver it to her later, she’d be fine.

s1_132_athena
Huh? You mean, you DIDN’T plant the scooter at the castle ruins? 

s1_133_sugar stamp
[Regretful] N-No. I… I lied about that, too. And in actuality, I didn’t even get to grab the body before I heard somepony coming and I had to hide in the trees again.

s1_134_twilight
Then, who brought it there? Who made it so that Scootaloo ended up being blamed for Royal’s death?

s1_135_turning page
[Guiltily] … That was me, Princess Twilight.

s1_136_twilight
[Shocked] W-What? Turning? How could you!

s1_137_turning page
[Quickly] I-It was an accident! You see, I tried to run after Scootaloo, but lost her, so I came running back to the body. 

s1_138_turning page
Once I saw the scooter again, I had made up my mind about what I would do.

s1_139_turning page
[Resolved] I didn’t want to follow Mom’s orders, but I also didn’t want to confess immediately. 

s1_140_turning page
Instead, I’d try to frame Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon for the crime.

s1_141_judge
Frame them? Why?

s1_142_turning page
[Angry] Because this was all their fault! If they hadn’t bullied and blackmailed the Cutie Mark Crusaders, NONE of this would have happened!

[Turning takes a moment to compose himself.]

s1_143_turning page
M-more than that, though, there was still the problem of Diamond’s mother, Spoiled Rich. She wanted us to pay for those dumb dresses.

s1_144_turning page
I figured, if I could get Diamond blamed for the murder, then maybe Mom and I could leverage the truth to get Spoiled Rich to back off.

s1_145_turning page
If she did, then I’d confess, Diamond Tiara would be acquitted, and Mom wouldn’t have to pay back a single bit. 

s1_146_turning page
That was my plan, anyway—and it would involve teleporting myself to the castle ruins with the body. 

s1_147_turning page
But, I accidentally teleported the scooter and wagon with me, too.

s1_148_twilight
Of course. Because anything that is in contact with the subject of teleportation will get teleported as well.

s1_149_athena
Sugar Stamp, did you see that happen?

s1_150_sugar stamp
[Concerned] I did, but I didn’t know where he teleported to! So I couldn’t help out in any other way. 

s1_151_sugar stamp
At that point I decided I’d just go and deliver Zecora’s letter, and maybe talk to Deva later about everything I’d seen. 

s1_152_twilight
What happened after you teleported, Turning Page?

s1_153_turning page
Well, I wanted to remove the scooter and wagon from the scene, but I had to rest for a second before I could teleport again. 

s1_154_turning page
That was when I heard somepony coming up the stairs from the gorge.

s1_155_athena
[Realizing] Diamond Tiara… Silver Spoon were already chasing after Scootaloo and you at that point.

s1_156_turning page
Yep. I couldn’t teleport again, so I chose to hide in the trees while she went to check the body. Not long after, Zecora showed up, making Diamond hide too. 

s1_157_turning page
At that point, I realized it’d be pointless to try and remove the scooter and wagon—both Zecora and Diamond had seen them.

s1_158_turning page
So, I figured that I could try and meet up with my mother back at the statue, and then tell her about what I did.

*FLASHBACK RESUMES*

s1_159_fair devotion
Turning, no! You can’t STILL insist on turning yourself in at the end of this!

s1_160_turning page
[Insistent] But what choice do we have, Mom?! If I don’t, somepony innocent will end up being accused! 

s1_161_turning page
And it doesn’t matter if that’s either Diamond Tiara OR Scootaloo—

s1_162_fair devotion
[Imploring] But we can STILL make it look like an accident—

s1_163_turning page
It’s too late for that! Two ponies have already SEEN the body AND the scooter and wagon. Somepony WILL be blamed for what happened to Dad.

s1_164_turning page
The least we can do is ENSURE that it’s ME in the end. Because I killed him! 

s1_165_turning page
[Bitterly] The only thing I’m waiting on now is if Diamond Tiara still ends up getting accused.

s1_166_fair devotion
I… Rrgh. W-we’ll discuss this later, Turning Page. For now, go home, and wait for me to return.

*END OF FLASHBACK*

s1_167_athena
So you were talking about all of this while at the statue, correct?

s1_168_turning page
That’s right.

s1_169_athena
Then that means… this was what you heard while you were behind the statue, right, Sweetie Belle?

[Sweetie Belle appears.]

s1_170_sweetie belle
[Hesitant] Y-Yeah. When I heard that  Turning… um… When I heard… what he did… to his dad, I thought… I thought I could use that to help Scootaloo.

s1_171_sweetie belle
I was sure he’d confess immediately just to save her. 

s1_172_twilight
But… you didn’t, Turning Page?

s1_173_turning page
[Regretful] N-no… maybe I should have. But I was still holding out hope that Diamond Tiara would be accused at some point. 

s1_174_turning page
By the time the trial began, though, I realized that wasn’t about to happen.

s1_175_turning page
And because of that, I was fully prepared to confess to the crime… 

s1_176_athena
!! T-then, when THAT happened…

*FLASHBACK TO 2-3.6*

TURNING
[Grateful] Thank you for fighting so hard for us, Ms. Cykes, but… [Sad] This is honestly for the best.

*END OF FLASHBACK*

s1_177_athena
You were prepared to throw your chance of freedom away… just to save Scootaloo?

s1_178_turning page
Yeah… But it didn’t matter. After all, you managed to get the both of us acquitted without needing me to confess. 

s1_179_turning page
I might have been okay with that, but then… Sweetie Belle was accused. 

s1_180_turning page
[Fired up] Another innocent pony was about to take the blame for what I did. I… I couldn’t let that happen again!

s1_181_turning page
[Quickly subdued] But… After the trial, Mom told me that confessing was out of the question. 

s1_182_turning page
Sure, it’d save Sweetie Belle, but… Scootaloo’s innocence might be questioned by other ponies. I couldn’t put her through that. 

s1_183_turning page
And by then, Ms. Stamp had already gotten involved as a suspect.

s1_184_turning page
Mom told me about double jeopardy, and how admitting my guilt would do nothing but hurt Ms. Stamp, who only wanted to save Sweetie and me. 

s1_185_turning page
I couldn’t do that. Not to somepony our family loved so much, and somepony that’s been hurt a lot already. 

s1_186_turning page
Confessing would make her efforts wasted, and knowing that, along with what Scootaloo might have to go through, left me feeling trapped.

s1_187_turning page
[Frustrated] I didn’t know what to do! No matter if I confessed or not, someone would be hurt. 

s1_188_turning page
All I could do was just follow along with my mom’s plan, and hope everyone would be happy by the end.

s1_189_athena
[Pensive] But… Sugar Stamp’s role as a suspect… that was orchestrated by you, Fair Devotion. 

s1_190_fair devotion
Correct, Ms. Cykes. Truthfully, I hadn’t planned on getting Sugar involved, but that day, when Turning was arrested…

*FLASHBACK BEGINS*

[At Fair Devotion’s house, knocking on the door. Opening it, we see Sugar Stamp.]

s1_191_fair devotion
S-Sugar Stamp? What are you doing here?

s1_192_sugar stamp
[Conflicted] H-Hi, Deva. I… I just wanted to check up on you and Turning Page.

s1_193_fair devotion
[Tired] Oh… well, thank you. But you’re too late. Turning’s already been arrested.

s1_194_sugar stamp
Y-yeah, I heard. I…

[Sugar Stamp takes a deep breath.]

s1_195_sugar stamp
Fair. I want you to know… I saw it. 

s1_196_fair devotion
Huh?

s1_197_sugar stamp
[Serious] Please don’t play dumb with me. We’ve been friends too long. I saw it, Fair. I saw what happened that night… I saw Turning kill his father.

s1_198_fair devotion
!!

s1_199_sugar stamp
Don’t worry. I don’t plan on telling anypony. But… I wanted to know if there was anything I could do to help out.

s1_200_fair devotion
H-Help out…? I mean… I don’t know, Sugar. I’m not sure how you could.

s1_201_fair devotion
I’ve been wracking my brain for a way to get Turning out of this mess, but the only thing I can think of is if I somehow were to take the fall.

s1_202_fair devotion
[Hesitant] But if I did that, who’d be able to take care of him? … W-would you?

s1_203_sugar stamp
[Just as hesitant] I-I don’t know, Deva. I… I don’t want to take Turning away from you.

s1_204_fair devotion
[Disappointed] Then… I guess…

s1_205_sugar stamp
W-well, hang on. What if, instead of YOU taking the fall, I did, instead?

s1_206_fair devotion
What?! You want to take the blame for killing Royal Order? I-I couldn’t allow that, Sugar!

s1_207_sugar stamp
But please, Deva! Think about Turning and yourself! If that happened, you both would be safe and happy! 

s1_208_sugar stamp
And… if you two were happy… then I could be, too. Even if I would have to be banished from Equestria.

s1_209_fair devotion
Sugar Stamp…

*END OF FLASHBACK*

s1_210_fair devotion
So it was decided. Between the two of us, we’d make it so that Sugar Stamp would appear to be the true culprit all along. 

s1_211_fair devotion
There were a number of steps we had to take to accomplish that, though. The first was acquiring a motive for Sugar Stamp. 

s1_212_fair devotion
After some thinking, I had her return to Canterlot to write a fake love letter to Royal Order. 

s1_213_fair devotion
She’d keep it in her home, as well as stay in Canterlot until further notice.

s1_214_fair devotion
The next day, I went to the trial to see how things played out for Turning and Scootaloo. I also wanted to learn any more details about the murder…

s1_215_fair devotion
… anything that could make Sugar Stamp being the culprit more believable.

s1_216_fair devotion
[Mildly impressed] Even so, I couldn’t have anticipated the clone theory you and Princess Twilight presented, Ms. Cykes. It was perfect. It cleared Turning of any suspicion.

s1_217_fair devotion
But there was just one problem—

s1_218_athena
—that being, that now there were two murders to account for. 

s1_219_fair devotion
Exactly. I realized that for my plan to still work, I’d have to take the blame for ONE of them. For that to happen, however, I needed help… Private?

s1_220_private eye
[Regretful] Ah. Yes, I suppose this is where I should explain my own role in this whole affair.

*FLASHBACK BEGINS*

[In the courtroom, in a secluded area. Fair approaches Private Eye.]

s1_221_private eye
[Cheerful] Ah, Ms. Devotion. How fortunate to have run into you! I must express my immense relief to see that Turning’s been acquitted. You must be equally relieved.

s1_222_fair devotion
[Gloomy] Mm… Not quite, Detective Eye.

s1_223_private eye
Please, Private is fine. But… why not? 

s1_224_fair devotion
[Serious] … What I’m about to tell you doesn’t leave the two of us. Can you promise me that?

s1_225_private eye
[Confused, then grave] Promise? … Very well. I promise I won’t tell another soul.

s1_226_fair devotion
Good.

[Fair Devotion takes a deep breath.]

s1_227_fair devotion
The truth is… there aren’t any clones involved. There’s only one death, and that’s Royal Order’s… and the pony who killed him was Turning Page.

s1_228_private eye
W-What?!

s1_229_private eye
If it is as you say, that Turning is guilty, and that it WAS an accident—we need to do something about that, now! 

s1_230_private eye
[Imploring] The warrant for Sweetie Belle’s arrest will no doubt soon be issued! We can still stop it, if we move quick enough!

s1_231_fair devotion
W-What? Why would there be a warrant for Sweetie Belle?

s1_232_private eye
Because it was HER blood found at the statue along with Royal Order’s. She was the other pony there on the night of the murder!

s1_233_fair devotion
!! Then that means…

s1_234_private eye
Ms. Devotion, please, there’s no way either of us can let that happen!

s1_235_fair devotion
But to stop that… surely you don’t mean I should give up my son for Sweetie’s freedom?

s1_236_private eye
[Hesitant] W-Well, I mean… 

s1_237_fair devotion
Do you really want him to be ostracized from the rest of Equestria for what he did?

s1_238_private eye
[Perturbed] N-No, of course not! Turning Page is the son of my friend! 

s1_239_private eye
But… the truth is the truth, isn’t it? And I can’t stand idly by and let somepony innocent be blamed.

s1_240_fair devotion
I have a few ideas. My friend Sugar Stamp and I are willing to take the fall for both deaths, but I’d need you to cooperate with me. 

s1_241_fair devotion
We can make it look like one of the fake murders was the result of a lover’s quarrel. That’ll absolve Sweetie, Turning, and everypony else involved.

s1_242_private eye
[Hesitant] I… I’m not sure…

s1_243_fair devotion
Please, Private. This WILL help Turning, and it WON’T hurt anypony who ISN’T willing to face the consequences.

s1_244_fair devotion
[Coy] Besides… I know what Royal Order was hiding—why he was in Canterlot for so long.

s1_245_private eye
!! Y-You do?!

s1_246_fair devotion
Yes. If you don’t help me on this… I won’t hesitate to reveal it.

s1_247_private eye
… 

*END OF FLASHBACK*

s1_248_athena
This secret… What is it, exactly?

[The court is silent.]

s1_249_athena
[Disappointed] (... That big, huh?)

s1_250_fair devotion
I was willing to say anything in order to get Private Eye on my side. In actuality, though, I never intended on revealing the truth. 

s1_251_fair devotion
Not that I believed I’d have to—I thought Private’s loyalty towards Royal Order would have convinced him anyway. 

s1_252_athena
[Disturbed] (Jeez… the levels of manipulation she was willing to go through…)

s1_253_fair devotion
Once he was on my side, I told him what I needed him to do. I’m sure you can figure out the rest, Ms. Cykes.

s1_254_athena
[Declarative] You would have asked him to fabricate evidence to implicate Sugar Stamp for one of the faux-murders. The one that supposedly happened at the clearing. 

s1_255_athena
More than that, you would have wanted evidence to show that the victim had been wearing armor prior to his death, in order to explain the clangs.

s1_256_fair devotion
Yes… And finally, I needed him to create evidence of Royal going to the Mirror Pool to clone himself in the first place.

s1_257_private eye
After Ms. Devotion told me her plan, I immediately set about completing what I was assigned. 

s1_258_private eye
I sealed off the forest, forged the evidence, and met with Sugar Stamp in Canterlot to fill her in.

s1_259_fair devotion
He performed marvelously, to the point where I thought my plan would work. But there was still one more wrinkle left to iron—the anonymous tip.

s1_260_fair devotion
[Determined] I had to stop whoever had written it from talking, since it appeared they knew what had happened that night. 

s1_261_fair devotion
I didn’t know who it could be until I learned that Sweetie Belle had been at the statue that night. That meant SHE was the sender.

s1_262_fair devotion
And furthermore: she must have heard the conversation between Turning and me. Realizing that, I went to the detention center to see if I could… change her mind.

s1_263_twilight
And that was why you were at the detention center when we went to see her…

s1_264_athena
Change her mind? Sweetie Belle, what does she mean?

s1_265_sweetie belle
[Hesitant] R-Right. So… we talked. And we agreed that we wouldn’t reveal each other’s secrets, so long as the two of us kept quiet. 

s1_266_fair devotion
And that was that. Everything was in place. Sugar and I would testify in a manner that would end with Ms. Cykes accusing me of the murder.

s1_267_fair devotion
[Disappointed] But… that wasn’t what ended up happening in the slightest. Somehow… everything fell apart.

[Fair sighs.]

s1_268_fair devotion
[Dejected] I just don’t understand how. Ms. Cykes… Athena… I should have been able to fool you. I fooled Private Eye, Princess Luna… but not you. 

s1_269_fair devotion
[Desperate - needs to know once and for all] How? How did you see past the lie?

s1_270_athena
[Solemn] … Because your emotions told me the truth, Ms. Devotion.

s1_271_fair devotion
[Confused] My… emotions?

s1_272_athena
For how strongly the evidence pointed towards you, your emotions still gave you away. You couldn’t hide them, no matter how much you might have wanted to.

s1_273_fair devotion
I see… 

s1_274_fair devotion
I have just one more question, Athena, if you would permit me to ask it…

s1_275_athena
Go ahead, Ms. Devotion.

s1_276_fair devotion
After everything you’ve heard, everything you’ve uncovered… Can you honestly say that this was worth it all?

s1_277_athena
[Not entirely convincing] … I found the truth, Ms. Devotion. That’s worth everything, I should think.

s1_278_fair devotion
I know that, and I agree, but what I mean is, if you had simply gone along with how I wanted things to progress…

s1_279_fair devotion
… wouldn’t things have ended better for all of us?

s1_280_fair devotion
You’ve torn through so much evidence and testimony, I’ll grant you that. But what WERE you able to save? What made this worth the cost?

[There’s another moment of silence, showing us the reactions of most of the characters. No one speaks.]

s1_281_athena
[Deeply conflicted] (... What made this worth the cost, indeed…?)
