ROYAL ORDER
[Shocked] Turning?!

TURNING PAGE
[Surprised] Dad? What are you doing here?

ROYAL ORDER
[Concerned] We… we were looking for you. Are you all right? Are you hurt?

TURNING PAGE
Y-Yeah, I’m fine… what were you and Mom arguing about?

ROYAL ORDER
[Questioning on 3rd sentence] You heard that? … Well, never you mind. Turning, what exactly are you doing in the Everfree Forest at this hour? Your mother and I were so worried!

TURNING PAGE
S-Sorry, Dad, but… it’s kinda a long story. 

TURNING PAGE
You see, a… very good friend of mine got into some trouble with these two fillies: Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon.

ROYAL ORDER
Trouble? What kind of trouble?

TURNING PAGE
[Angry] They… They’d stolen some of her stuff. And they were blackmailing her so that she’d get them something they wanted in exchange! 

TURNING PAGE
They arranged to meet in the forest, by the castle ruins, to conduct the exchange. My friend came to me for help, and I agreed.

TURNING PAGE
So, I went with her, to make sure that she didn’t get hurt, and to make sure the deal went smoothly.

ROYAL ORDER
[Surprised] You… came out here without an adult?

TURNING PAGE
Well, yeah! I couldn’t just let her go off on her own! Besides, I wanted to teach those blackmailers a lesson! 

ROYAL ORDER
[Worried] A lesson…? 

TURNING PAGE
[Excited, satisfied] Right, a lesson. It’s like you’ve always taught me! Evildoers beware, or taste the might of my sword! I’d say those fillies got a good taste of it, all right!

[Turning levitates his broken sword in front of him, and Royal notes the damage.]

ROYAL ORDER
Your sword… it’s broken.

TURNING PAGE
[Cheerfully] Yeah… I guess I swung it a little too hard. Oh, well! Nothing that a bit of duct tape won’t fix!

ROYAL ORDER
(He could have seriously hurt somepony! And if he wasn’t careful with his swing, he might have hurt his friend… or even himself!)

ROYAL ORDER
[Guilty] (This… This must be what Fair meant. His reckless behavior at home… Is it really my fault? Have I led him that far astray?)

ROYAL ORDER
I’m afraid I still don’t quite fully understand, Turning. You still came out to a dangerous forest armed with nothing but that wooden sword.

TURNING PAGE
[Not understanding] Yeah, and? 

ROYAL ORDER
What if you’d gotten attacked by something, like a wild animal? Or worse… what if your friend had?

TURNING PAGE
[Confident] Come on, Dad! That’s why I went with her in the first place! 

TURNING PAGE
Besides, I’m pretty sure I could take on anycreature in this forest! Your training has definitely proven that! HIYAH!

[Turning proudly swings his sword again.]

TURNING PAGE
[Excited] If nothing else, it would have proven a great way to test my skills! Hey! Maybe you could teach me a few new strikes that only a Royal Guard would know!

ROYAL ORDER
My training…

ROYAL ORDER
(Stars above… Fair was right. This IS my fault! How do I even begin to confront this issue?)

ROYAL ORDER
[Tone of warning] Turning Page… 

[Turning, previously excited, notes the change in his father’s tone. He lowers his sword and looks at him, confused.]

ROYAL ORDER
I… We need to talk about that, actually. Your… “training.”

TURNING PAGE
O-oh? Okay… Um, what about it?

ROYAL ORDER
[Delicately] It’s just… maybe we should, you know… ease up on it for a bit. 

TURNING PAGE
Ease… up?

ROYAL ORDER
Right… it’s just, well… I know you’re still enthusiastic about joining the Royal Guard, but… maybe now isn’t the best time.

TURNING PAGE
W-what? What do you mean?

ROYAL ORDER
Look, son. There’s… there’s a lot going on in the world, right now. Crazy stuff. Dangerous stuff. 

ROYAL ORDER
Even with your training… I’m just concerned about your safety, that’s all.

[Turning is silent, uncomprehending. Royal rushes on, attempting to explain himself.]

ROYAL ORDER
[Delicately] A-and your mother and I, well, we think it might be better if you focus on something less risky. For the time being, of course!

ROYAL ORDER
Though that WOULD mean you would have to attend school.

TURNING PAGE
[Shocked] W-What?!

ROYAL ORDER
I understand that school is a bit of a sore topic for you, but you DO have to attend. 

TURNING PAGE
B-But what about joining the Royal Guard?!

ROYAL ORDER
I’m not saying you can’t, just that… you should wait. Learn some patience. Be a little less reckless with yourself, show some forethought, that sort of thing.

TURNING PAGE
Are you saying I’m not ready?!

ROYAL ORDER
[sigh] No, Turning Page, you aren’t. Not… not by a long shot.

TURNING PAGE
[Defensive] How can you say that?! I-I’m more than ready to join! I-I save ponies and hurt those who want to do bad things, like Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon and—

ROYAL ORDER
But that’s my point, Turning Page. 

ROYAL ORDER
You hurt them, yes, but don’t you know what that resulted in? Spoiled Rich demanding we pay for the damages you wrought!

ROYAL ORDER
[Lecturing] Had you not been so reckless as to attack those fillies—

TURNING PAGE
But they DESERVED it—

ROYAL ORDER
That’s not for either of us to say, Turning. And even if they DID, attacking them has only landed us in a truly dire situation.

ROYAL ORDER
[Lecturing] You can’t be this reckless. Not if you want to join the Royal Guard… and certainly not for the rest of your life.

TURNING PAGE
!!

ROYAL ORDER
That’s why I think it would be best if you DO start attending school. If nothing else, perhaps the social interaction will teach you how to keep a cool head. 

TURNING PAGE
[Even more worried and hurt] W-what… but… I… W-What about our sparring sessions? D-Does this mean we can’t have them anymore?

ROYAL ORDER
[Distant] I… I’m afraid not. My job in Canterlot is… about to be even more demanding of my time. 

ROYAL ORDER
[Second sentence slightly under breath] I probably won’t be able to come home all that often… much to your mother’s disappointment…

TURNING PAGE
[Outraged] Your job? B-but why? How does working in some stuffy place like Canterlot lead to more work for you?!

ROYAL ORDER
… I’m sorry, Turning. I can’t tell you that.

TURNING PAGE
Nngk! 

ROYAL ORDER
I know this comes as a great shock to you, son, but… 

ROYAL ORDER
[Attempting to placate Turning] If you simply listen to your mother, and start attending school, everything will play out just fine. I promise. 

TURNING PAGE
I… I… 

[Turning begins to shake. Royal, concerned, approaches him.]

ROYAL ORDER
Turning? Are… Are you all right—

TURNING PAGE
YYYEEEAAAAAGGHHH!

TURNING PAGE
[Breathing heavily]... ? H-Huh? W-what… what the…

TURNING PAGE
…D-Dad?

*END OF FLASHBACK*

JUDGE
 …

JUDGE
[Solemn] This has… left me truly speechless.

LUNA
[Serious] This is a grave turn of events, Your Honor. I expect many of us are at a loss for words.

ATHENA
[Attempting to recover] Turning, you… You must have been in complete shock afterwards.

TURNING PAGE
I was. It just happened so fast. I couldn’t believe my eyes—I thought he would somehow be fine.

TWILIGHT
It was the poison joke. He’d gotten infected while looking around Froggy Bottom Bog, and it took effect by the time you had confronted him. 

TURNING PAGE
Once I’d recovered enough, I levitated him down from the spike, to see if I could help him, but… 

TURNING PAGE
[Horrified] He just kept gushing blood. Everywhere. The statue, the ground… it was all covered. I wanted to scream, but my voice just wouldn’t come out.

FAIR DEVOTION
[Quietly] And that was when I came rushing back. 

[Fair momentarily composes herself, and when she looks at Athena and speaks, it’s almost with a bittersweet, begrudging tone.]

FAIR DEVOTION
[Bittersweet] Honestly, I’m impressed you managed to piece it together so thoroughly, Ms. Cykes. I DID run off after Royal Order and I fought… and I did come back afterwards.

TWILIGHT
I’m guessing it was the clang that got you to turn back?

FAIR DEVOTION
[Solemn] That’s right. The clang… that came from Turning hitting his father with his sword.

*FLASHBACK RESUMES*

FAIR DEVOTION
[Confused] W-What the—Turning Page? What happened here?

TURNING PAGE
Mom, I… I… It was an accident, I swear, I just got so angry and—

FAIR DEVOTION
[gasp] R-Royal?! H-hang on, honey, j-just—

[But when Fair reaches his body, she realizes it’s too late.]

FAIR DEVOTION
[quietly, on the verge of panic] Oh, no. Oh, no no no, no… 

TURNING PAGE
M-Mom? I-is there anything we can do?

FAIR DEVOTION
[Quietly] … N-no. He’s… He’s already gone.

TURNING PAGE
[subdued] No…

[Silence descends upon the scene for but a moment. Then Turning squares himself up.]

TURNING PAGE
[Serious] I’ll do it.

FAIR DEVOTION
You’ll… what?

TURNING PAGE
Turn myself in. It’s my fault, after all, and… It’s the right thing to do.

FAIR DEVOTION
N-No!

[Turning is taken aback by her outburst.]

FAIR DEVOTION
[Desperate, trying to compose herself] Please, just… listen to me. I’m… I’m so grateful you’re alive, Turning. I was worried that… Well, I… You can’t turn yourself in!

TURNING PAGE
B-but Mom—

FAIR DEVOTION
Even if this was an accident, the police won’t care! They’ll treat it like a murder! 

FAIR DEVOTION
[Frantic] And you know what happens to murderers—they’re banished from Equestria, no matter who they are!

FAIR DEVOTION
Royal wouldn’t want that. He wanted you to become a member of the Royal Guard one day, not throw it all away because of… because of some accident!

FAIR DEVOTION
[Pleading] Please, Turning… I… I can’t bear to lose you, too.

TURNING PAGE
B-but, Mom… I did this. D-Don’t I have to pay for it?

[Fair begins to think.]

FAIR DEVOTION
… No, Turning. After all, you didn’t do this.

TURNING PAGE
Huh?

FAIR DEVOTION
[Coyly] It was… it was the result of an attack by some of the forest’s creatures. That’s what happened here. Nothing else. And here’s how we’ll make it so… 

*END OF FLASHBACK*

ATHENA
Hold up a second, Ms. Devotion. Before you continue, I’d like to ask Sugar Stamp something.

[Sugar Stamp appears.]

ATHENA
Sugar Stamp, the one thing you’ve been consistent on throughout this trial was that you saw the murder happen with your own eyes. 

ATHENA
Given what we now know, could you elaborate on that?

SUGAR STAMP
Y-yeah. I… I was in the forest that night delivering a letter to Zecora. I meant to fly to her hut right away, but… I heard a clang from somewhere in the woods.

SUGAR STAMP
When I went to investigate, I saw Turning remove his father’s body from the statue. 

SUGAR STAMP
I didn’t understand what had happened—not yet—but just as I was about to fly down and ask…

SUGAR STAMP
… That’s when Deva showed up.

TWILIGHT
But you didn’t leave?

SUGAR STAMP
No, even though I thought I should. But… I couldn’t leave them. Turning looked so scared, and Deva… She looked so broken. 

SUGAR STAMP
I didn’t want to interfere with whatever conversation they were having, but I figured I could just… watch. 

LUNA
And that must be when you overheard the witness’s plan. 

SUGAR STAMP
Yeah. It’s just as Fair had claimed before… but this time, Turning was the one complicit with it. 

TURNING PAGE
I didn’t want to go through with it, to be honest, but seeing Mom so upset, and remembering what my dad said to me before he…

[Turning trails off, but Athena figures out the rest for him.]

ATHENA
[Solemnly] (“If you simply listen to your mother… everything will play out just fine. I promise.”)

TURNING PAGE
Well, I decided that I couldn’t refuse. So… I did as she told me. 

TURNING PAGE
The first thing I did was move Dad’s body from the statue over to the crossroads, leaving the armor behind. Mom followed next to me.

SUGAR STAMP
[Concerned] While he did that, I kept watch, flying from tree to tree. The body… It kept leaking blood everywhere, leaving a trail behind them.

TURNING PAGE
We would have continued, but that was when we heard ANOTHER clang—coming from the statue.

TWILIGHT
The second clang… The one that Sweetie Belle made in order to scare off the timberwolves.

FAIR DEVOTION
After we heard that, I told Turning to continue to Froggy Bottom Bog, then rushed back to the statue, afraid somepony had discovered the scene. 

FAIR DEVOTION
When I got to the statue, though, nopony was there. Only the armor and blood were. 

ATHENA
I see… And that’s when you must have moved the blood, as well as the armor, farther into the forest—to the clearing.

TWILIGHT
All in order to suggest that timberwolves had attacked Royal Order and eaten his body.

TURNING PAGE
While Mom was doing that, though, I stopped at the crossroads. I was starting to have second thoughts. 

TURNING PAGE
I know Dad said I should listen to Mom, but still, lying? It… It felt horrible.

TURNING PAGE
But before I could come to a decision, I heard somepony coming. Thinking quickly, I ducked behind the body. And that…

LUNA
… was when Scootaloo crashed into you.

TURNING PAGE
[Pained] Yeah. It took everything I had in me to avoid screaming. But I realized soon after who had hit me. 

TURNING PAGE
I tried to call out to her, but she was already running away, so I ran after her instead.

SUGAR STAMP
He’d left the body behind, and… that was when I decided to try and help out. I flew down to the scene to grab the body and move the scooter.

ATHENA
Move the scooter?

SUGAR STAMP
Yeah. I didn’t want Scootaloo to be blamed for Royal’s death, so I figured if I could move it, then deliver it to her later, she’d be fine.

ATHENA
Huh? You mean, you DIDN’T plant the scooter at the castle ruins? 

SUGAR STAMP
[Regretful] N-No. I… I lied about that, too. And in actuality, I didn’t even get to grab the body before I heard somepony coming and I had to hide in the trees again.

TWILIGHT
Then, who brought it there? Who made it so that Scootaloo ended up being blamed for Royal’s death?

TURNING PAGE
[Guiltily] … That was me, Princess Twilight.

TWILIGHT
[Shocked] W-What? Turning? How could you!

TURNING PAGE
[Quickly] I-It was an accident! You see, I tried to run after Scootaloo, but lost her, so I came running back to the body. 

TURNING PAGE
Once I saw the scooter again, I had made up my mind about what I would do.

TURNING PAGE
[Resolved] I didn’t want to follow Mom’s orders, but I also didn’t want to confess immediately. 

TURNING PAGE
Instead, I’d try to frame Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon for the crime.

JUDGE
Frame them? Why?

TURNING PAGE
[Angry] Because this was all their fault! If they hadn’t bullied and blackmailed the Cutie Mark Crusaders, NONE of this would have happened!

[Turning takes a moment to compose himself.]

TURNING PAGE
M-more than that, though, there was still the problem of Diamond’s mother, Spoiled Rich. She wanted us to pay for those dumb dresses.

TURNING PAGE
I figured, if I could get Diamond blamed for the murder, then maybe Mom and I could leverage the truth to get Spoiled Rich to back off.

TURNING PAGE
If she did, then I’d confess, Diamond Tiara would be acquitted, and Mom wouldn’t have to pay back a single bit. 

TURNING PAGE
That was my plan, anyway—and it would involve teleporting myself to the castle ruins with the body. 

TURNING PAGE
But, I accidentally teleported the scooter and wagon with me, too.

TWILIGHT
Of course. Because anything that is in contact with the subject of teleportation will get teleported as well.

ATHENA
Sugar Stamp, did you see that happen?

SUGAR STAMP
[Concerned] I did, but I didn’t know where he teleported to! So I couldn’t help out in any other way. 

SUGAR STAMP
At that point I decided I’d just go and deliver Zecora’s letter, and maybe talk to Deva later about everything I’d seen. 

TWILIGHT
What happened after you teleported, Turning Page?

TURNING PAGE
Well, I wanted to remove the scooter and wagon from the scene, but I had to rest for a second before I could teleport again. 

TURNING PAGE
That was when I heard somepony coming up the stairs from the gorge.

ATHENA
[Realizing] Diamond Tiara… Silver Spoon were already chasing after Scootaloo and you at that point.

TURNING PAGE
Yep. I couldn’t teleport again, so I chose to hide in the trees while she went to check the body. Not long after, Zecora showed up, making Diamond hide too. 

TURNING PAGE
At that point, I realized it’d be pointless to try and remove the scooter and wagon—both Zecora and Diamond had seen them.

TURNING PAGE
So, I figured that I could try and meet up with my mother back at the statue, and then tell her about what I did.

*FLASHBACK RESUMES*

FAIR DEVOTION
Turning, no! You can’t STILL insist on turning yourself in at the end of this!

TURNING PAGE
[Insistent] But what choice do we have, Mom?! If I don’t, somepony innocent will end up being accused! 

TURNING PAGE
And it doesn’t matter if that’s either Diamond Tiara OR Scootaloo—

FAIR DEVOTION
[Imploring] But we can STILL make it look like an accident—

TURNING PAGE
It’s too late for that! Two ponies have already SEEN the body AND the scooter and wagon. Somepony WILL be blamed for what happened to Dad.

TURNING PAGE
The least we can do is ENSURE that it’s ME in the end. Because I killed him! 

TURNING PAGE
[Bitterly] The only thing I’m waiting on now is if Diamond Tiara still ends up getting accused.

FAIR DEVOTION
I… Rrgh. W-we’ll discuss this later, Turning Page. For now, go home, and wait for me to return.

*END OF FLASHBACK*

ATHENA
So you were talking about all of this while at the statue, correct?

TURNING PAGE
That’s right.

ATHENA
Then that means… this was what you heard while you were behind the statue, right, Sweetie Belle?

[Sweetie Belle appears.]

SWEETIE BELLE
[Hesitant] Y-Yeah. When I heard that  Turning… um… When I heard… what he did… to his dad, I thought… I thought I could use that to help Scootaloo.

SWEETIE BELLE
I was sure he’d confess immediately just to save her. 

TWILIGHT
But… you didn’t, Turning Page?

TURNING PAGE
[Regretful] N-no… maybe I should have. But I was still holding out hope that Diamond Tiara would be accused at some point. 

TURNING PAGE
By the time the trial began, though, I realized that wasn’t about to happen.

TURNING PAGE
And because of that, I was fully prepared to confess to the crime… 

ATHENA
!! T-then, when THAT happened…

*FLASHBACK TO 2-3.6*

TURNING
[Grateful] Thank you for fighting so hard for us, Ms. Cykes, but… [Sad] This is honestly for the best.

*END OF FLASHBACK*

ATHENA
You were prepared to throw your chance of freedom away… just to save Scootaloo?

TURNING PAGE
Yeah… But it didn’t matter. After all, you managed to get the both of us acquitted without needing me to confess. 

TURNING PAGE
I might have been okay with that, but then… Sweetie Belle was accused. 

TURNING PAGE
[Fired up] Another innocent pony was about to take the blame for what I did. I… I couldn’t let that happen again!

TURNING PAGE
[Quickly subdued] But… After the trial, Mom told me that confessing was out of the question. 

TURNING PAGE
Sure, it’d save Sweetie Belle, but… Scootaloo’s innocence might be questioned by other ponies. I couldn’t put her through that. 

TURNING PAGE
And by then, Ms. Stamp had already gotten involved as a suspect.

TURNING PAGE
Mom told me about double jeopardy, and how admitting my guilt would do nothing but hurt Ms. Stamp, who only wanted to save Sweetie and me. 

TURNING PAGE
I couldn’t do that. Not to somepony our family loved so much, and somepony that’s been hurt a lot already. 

TURNING PAGE
Confessing would make her efforts wasted, and knowing that, along with what Scootaloo might have to go through, left me feeling trapped.

TURNING PAGE
[Frustrated] I didn’t know what to do! No matter if I confessed or not, someone would be hurt. 

TURNING PAGE
All I could do was just follow along with my mom’s plan, and hope everyone would be happy by the end.

ATHENA
[Pensive] But… Sugar Stamp’s role as a suspect… that was orchestrated by you, Fair Devotion. 

FAIR DEVOTION
Correct, Ms. Cykes. Truthfully, I hadn’t planned on getting Sugar involved, but that day, when Turning was arrested…

*FLASHBACK BEGINS*

[At Fair Devotion’s house, knocking on the door. Opening it, we see Sugar Stamp.]

FAIR DEVOTION
S-Sugar Stamp? What are you doing here?

SUGAR STAMP
[Conflicted] H-Hi, Deva. I… I just wanted to check up on you and Turning Page.

FAIR DEVOTION
[Tired] Oh… well, thank you. But you’re too late. Turning’s already been arrested.

SUGAR STAMP
Y-yeah, I heard. I…

[Sugar Stamp takes a deep breath.]

SUGAR STAMP
Fair. I want you to know… I saw it. 

FAIR DEVOTION
Huh?

SUGAR STAMP
[Serious] Please don’t play dumb with me. We’ve been friends too long. I saw it, Fair. I saw what happened that night… I saw Turning kill his father.

FAIR DEVOTION
!!

SUGAR STAMP
Don’t worry. I don’t plan on telling anypony. But… I wanted to know if there was anything I could do to help out.

FAIR DEVOTION
H-Help out…? I mean… I don’t know, Sugar. I’m not sure how you could.

FAIR DEVOTION
I’ve been wracking my brain for a way to get Turning out of this mess, but the only thing I can think of is if I somehow were to take the fall.

FAIR DEVOTION
[Hesitant] But if I did that, who’d be able to take care of him? … W-would you?

SUGAR STAMP
[Just as hesitant] I-I don’t know, Deva. I… I don’t want to take Turning away from you.

FAIR DEVOTION
[Disappointed] Then… I guess…

SUGAR STAMP
W-well, hang on. What if, instead of YOU taking the fall, I did, instead?

FAIR DEVOTION
What?! You want to take the blame for killing Royal Order? I-I couldn’t allow that, Sugar!

SUGAR STAMP
But please, Deva! Think about Turning and yourself! If that happened, you both would be safe and happy! 

SUGAR STAMP
And… if you two were happy… then I could be, too. Even if I would have to be banished from Equestria.

FAIR DEVOTION
Sugar Stamp…

*END OF FLASHBACK*

FAIR DEVOTION
So it was decided. Between the two of us, we’d make it so that Sugar Stamp would appear to be the true culprit all along. 

FAIR DEVOTION
There were a number of steps we had to take to accomplish that, though. The first was acquiring a motive for Sugar Stamp. 

FAIR DEVOTION
After some thinking, I had her return to Canterlot to write a fake love letter to Royal Order. 

FAIR DEVOTION
She’d keep it in her home, as well as stay in Canterlot until further notice.

FAIR DEVOTION
The next day, I went to the trial to see how things played out for Turning and Scootaloo. I also wanted to learn any more details about the murder…

FAIR DEVOTION
… anything that could make Sugar Stamp being the culprit more believable.

FAIR DEVOTION
[Mildly impressed] Even so, I couldn’t have anticipated the clone theory you and Princess Twilight presented, Ms. Cykes. It was perfect. It cleared Turning of any suspicion.

FAIR DEVOTION
But there was just one problem—

ATHENA
—that being, that now there were two murders to account for. 

FAIR DEVOTION
Exactly. I realized that for my plan to still work, I’d have to take the blame for ONE of them. For that to happen, however, I needed help… Private?

PRIVATE EYE
[Regretful] Ah. Yes, I suppose this is where I should explain my own role in this whole affair.

*FLASHBACK BEGINS*

[In the courtroom, in a secluded area. Fair approaches Private Eye.]

PRIVATE EYE
[Cheerful] Ah, Ms. Devotion. How fortunate to have run into you! I must express my immense relief to see that Turning’s been acquitted. You must be equally relieved.

FAIR DEVOTION
[Gloomy] Mm… Not quite, Detective Eye.

PRIVATE EYE
Please, Private is fine. But… why not? 

FAIR DEVOTION
[Serious] … What I’m about to tell you doesn’t leave the two of us. Can you promise me that?

PRIVATE EYE
[Confused, then grave] Promise? … Very well. I promise I won’t tell another soul.

FAIR DEVOTION
Good.

[Fair Devotion takes a deep breath.]

FAIR DEVOTION
The truth is… there aren’t any clones involved. There’s only one death, and that’s Royal Order’s… and the pony who killed him was Turning Page.

PRIVATE EYE
W-What?!

PRIVATE EYE
If it is as you say, that Turning is guilty, and that it WAS an accident—we need to do something about that, now! 

PRIVATE EYE
[Imploring] The warrant for Sweetie Belle’s arrest will no doubt soon be issued! We can still stop it, if we move quick enough!

FAIR DEVOTION
W-What? Why would there be a warrant for Sweetie Belle?

PRIVATE EYE
Because it was HER blood found at the statue along with Royal Order’s. She was the other pony there on the night of the murder!

FAIR DEVOTION
!! Then that means…

PRIVATE EYE
Ms. Devotion, please, there’s no way either of us can let that happen!

FAIR DEVOTION
But to stop that… surely you don’t mean I should give up my son for Sweetie’s freedom?

PRIVATE EYE
[Hesitant] W-Well, I mean… 

FAIR DEVOTION
Do you really want him to be ostracized from the rest of Equestria for what he did?

PRIVATE EYE
[Perturbed] N-No, of course not! Turning Page is the son of my friend! 

PRIVATE EYE
But… the truth is the truth, isn’t it? And I can’t stand idly by and let somepony innocent be blamed.

FAIR DEVOTION
I have a few ideas. My friend Sugar Stamp and I are willing to take the fall for both deaths, but I’d need you to cooperate with me. 

FAIR DEVOTION
We can make it look like one of the fake murders was the result of a lover’s quarrel. That’ll absolve Sweetie, Turning, and everypony else involved.

PRIVATE EYE
[Hesitant] I… I’m not sure…

FAIR DEVOTION
Please, Private. This WILL help Turning, and it WON’T hurt anypony who ISN’T willing to face the consequences.

FAIR DEVOTION
[Coy] Besides… I know what Royal Order was hiding—why he was in Canterlot for so long.

PRIVATE EYE
!! Y-You do?!

FAIR DEVOTION
Yes. If you don’t help me on this… I won’t hesitate to reveal it.

PRIVATE EYE
… 

*END OF FLASHBACK*

ATHENA
This secret… What is it, exactly?

[The court is silent.]

ATHENA
[Disappointed] (... That big, huh?)

FAIR DEVOTION
I was willing to say anything in order to get Private Eye on my side. In actuality, though, I never intended on revealing the truth. 

FAIR DEVOTION
Not that I believed I’d have to—I thought Private’s loyalty towards Royal Order would have convinced him anyway. 

ATHENA
[Disturbed] (Jeez… the levels of manipulation she was willing to go through…)

FAIR DEVOTION
Once he was on my side, I told him what I needed him to do. I’m sure you can figure out the rest, Ms. Cykes.

ATHENA
[Declarative] You would have asked him to fabricate evidence to implicate Sugar Stamp for one of the faux-murders. The one that supposedly happened at the clearing. 

ATHENA
More than that, you would have wanted evidence to show that the victim had been wearing armor prior to his death, in order to explain the clangs.

FAIR DEVOTION
Yes… And finally, I needed him to create evidence of Royal going to the Mirror Pool to clone himself in the first place.

PRIVATE EYE
After Ms. Devotion told me her plan, I immediately set about completing what I was assigned. 

PRIVATE EYE
I sealed off the forest, forged the evidence, and met with Sugar Stamp in Canterlot to fill her in.

FAIR DEVOTION
He performed marvelously, to the point where I thought my plan would work. But there was still one more wrinkle left to iron—the anonymous tip.

FAIR DEVOTION
[Determined] I had to stop whoever had written it from talking, since it appeared they knew what had happened that night. 

FAIR DEVOTION
I didn’t know who it could be until I learned that Sweetie Belle had been at the statue that night. That meant SHE was the sender.

FAIR DEVOTION
And furthermore: she must have heard the conversation between Turning and me. Realizing that, I went to the detention center to see if I could… change her mind.

TWILIGHT
And that was why you were at the detention center when we went to see her…

ATHENA
Change her mind? Sweetie Belle, what does she mean?

SWEETIE BELLE
[Hesitant] R-Right. So… we talked. And we agreed that we wouldn’t reveal each other’s secrets, so long as the two of us kept quiet. 

FAIR DEVOTION
And that was that. Everything was in place. Sugar and I would testify in a manner that would end with Ms. Cykes accusing me of the murder.

FAIR DEVOTION
[Disappointed] But… that wasn’t what ended up happening in the slightest. Somehow… everything fell apart.

[Fair sighs.]

FAIR DEVOTION
[Dejected] I just don’t understand how. Ms. Cykes… Athena… I should have been able to fool you. I fooled Private Eye, Princess Luna… but not you. 

FAIR DEVOTION
[Desperate - needs to know once and for all] How? How did you see past the lie?

ATHENA
[Solemn] … Because your emotions told me the truth, Ms. Devotion.

FAIR DEVOTION
[Confused] My… emotions?

ATHENA
For how strongly the evidence pointed towards you, your emotions still gave you away. You couldn’t hide them, no matter how much you might have wanted to.

FAIR DEVOTION
I see… 

FAIR DEVOTION
I have just one more question, Athena, if you would permit me to ask it…

ATHENA
Go ahead, Ms. Devotion.

FAIR DEVOTION
After everything you’ve heard, everything you’ve uncovered… Can you honestly say that this was worth it all?

ATHENA
[Not entirely convincing] … I found the truth, Ms. Devotion. That’s worth everything, I should think.

FAIR DEVOTION
I know that, and I agree, but what I mean is, if you had simply gone along with how I wanted things to progress…

FAIR DEVOTION
… wouldn’t things have ended better for all of us?

FAIR DEVOTION
You’ve torn through so much evidence and testimony, I’ll grant you that. But what WERE you able to save? What made this worth the cost?

[There’s another moment of silence, showing us the reactions of most of the characters. No one speaks.]

ATHENA
[Deeply conflicted] (... What made this worth the cost, indeed…?)
