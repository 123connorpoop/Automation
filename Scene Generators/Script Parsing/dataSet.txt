Say what?! Ponies can walk into [sfx-huh] DREAMS, now?! 

Polly, at some point you’re gonna have to accept that this is just how this world works. 

Easy for you to say. 

Never mind that part. Athena, you’re saying that Luna also wants what we want: to ensure Sweetie Belle gets a not guilty verdict.

Yeah, and that she thinks the true culprit is either Fair Devotion or Sugar Stamp, possibly both of them..

There’s certainly strong evidence to suggest at least one was directly involved… But what do you think, Athena?

What do I think…

(What [sfs-lightbulb] DO I think? Yesterday I was still a bit uncertain, but after that dream, I think I have a better idea… )

Nothing definitive, Boss, but I think that this trial will lead us to the answers we need.

Still, if Princess Luna believes Sugar Stamp or Fair Devotion are guilty, the defendant being Sweetie Belle puts her in a rather difficult situation. 

It sounds like she’ll be relying on us once again to reveal Sweetie Belle’s innocence, like she did with Turning Page and Scootaloo. 

Yeah… though, exactly HOW she plans on doing that, we don’t know. It’s probably best to not dwell on that for now.

If last night’s dream taught me anything, it’s that we ARE on the same side.
