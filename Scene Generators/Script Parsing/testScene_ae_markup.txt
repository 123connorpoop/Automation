Apple Bloom’s right.

s1_002_twilight
I know everypony is upset, but we need to focus on the case at hoof. Arguing like this is going to get us nowhere.

s1_003_twilight
You shouldn’t put the blame on yourself, Athena. I took part in this as well.

s1_004_twilight
None of us want to see a friend accused of a crime they didn’t commit. So I promise, we’ll also make sure that Sweetie Belle gets the acquittal she deserves.

s1_005_twilight
And Athena by mine…!

s1_006_twilight
We will prove her innocence together!

s1_007_twilight
We won’t let you down, Rarity!

s1_008_twilight
Well, we know that clones were involved.

s1_009_twilight
Maybe it’ll help if we go over Royal Order’s movements that night? 

s1_010_twilight
Everything that we know and need to know center around figuring out what he did and where he did them. 

s1_011_twilight
How about when he first got home? We know that that was when he learned what Turning Page was doing from Fair Devotion. 

s1_012_twilight
And we know what happened on the way there…

s1_013_twilight
Exactly. We managed to establish that that was ONE of the Royal Order clones. 

s1_014_twilight
The crash resulted in the scooter breaking and the left handlebar stabbing Royal Order’s head.

s1_015_twilight
No. That stab wound must not have been fatal since, based on the blood trail, that that Royal Order managed to stand and head over to the Nightmare Night statue.

s1_016_twilight
THAT was where he was killed. Impaled on the statue’s base, somehow. The timberwolves in the area then ate the body, and lapped up all the blood afterwards.

s1_017_twilight
That’s… where we believe Sugar Stamp was involved. The imprint on the bottom of the wagon matches the badge on her mail bag. 

s1_018_twilight
We think she transported the items from the crossroads…

s1_019_twilight
Scootaloo and Turning Page might be there, too, so we should talk to them as well. Maybe we could even speak to Zecora, if she’s there.

s1_020_twilight
There’s also the Everfree Forest. Now that we know that the clearing and crossroads were involved, we’ll need to investigate them thoroughly.

s1_021_twilight
Applejack? What about you?

s1_022_twilight
In which case, we’d better get going—

s1_023_twilight
Just a sec. Spike, you don’t mind…

s1_024_twilight
We’ll do our best, Spike! Okay, everyone. Let’s get going!
