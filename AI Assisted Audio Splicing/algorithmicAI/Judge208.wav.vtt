 Why is that?

14:20.560 --> 14:23.560
 Why is that?

14:23.560 --> 14:35.560
 Why is that?

14:35.560 --> 14:45.560
 Defense.

14:45.560 --> 14:50.560
 Defense.

14:50.560 --> 15:05.560
 Defense.

15:05.560 --> 15:26.560
 Surely you're not asking the defendant to go back into the Everfree Forest just to grab a bunch of material.

15:26.560 --> 15:31.560
 Defense.

15:31.560 --> 15:34.560
 Surely you're not asking the defendant to go back into the Everfree Forest just to grab a bunch of material.

 And surely you don't expect us to go in there with her?

15:39.560 --> 15:44.560
 And surely you don't expect us to go in there with her?

15:44.560 --> 15:53.560

 Forgive me witness.

16:23.560 --> 16:25.560
 I believe I misheard you.

16:25.560 --> 16:30.560

 Hmm?

17:22.560 --> 17:24.560
 Forgive me witness.

17:24.560 --> 17:27.560
 But I believe I misheard you.

17:27.560 --> 17:31.560

 But who?

17:57.560 --> 18:01.560
 But who?

18:01.560 --> 18:02.560
 Hmm?

18:02.560 --> 18:05.560
 But who?

18:05.560 --> 18:11.560
 But who?

18:11.560 --> 18:14.560
 Miss Sweety Bell?

18:14.560 --> 18:18.560
 Miss Sweety Bell?

18:18.560 --> 18:21.560
 Miss Sweety Bell?

18:21.560 --> 18:24.560
 Miss Sweety Bell?

18:36.560 --> 18:38.560
 But who?

18:38.560 --> 18:41.560
 There was no one else at the statue.

18:41.560 --> 18:45.560
 But who?

18:45.560 --> 18:48.560
 There was no one else at the statue.

 Laterpairs to be...

22:36.560 --> 22:43.560
 Laterpairs to indeed be a repaid of what we have heard from the...

22:44.560 --> 22:50.560
 Maybe it would help if I actually read the line before I actually spoke it.

22:51.560 --> 22:56.560
 And try to clear the sweat dripping for my glasses.

22:58.560 --> 23:00.560
 I need some other ventilation in here.

23:01.560 --> 23:02.560
 Oh wow, that did nothing.

23:02.560 --> 23:07.560
 That only made it worse. Okay, I'm gonna pause for a minute so I can properly clean my glasses.

23:08.560 --> 23:09.560
 Okay, that's much better.

23:10.560 --> 23:12.560
 Alright, let's try it again.

23:15.560 --> 23:16.560
 Defense?

23:22.560 --> 23:23.560
 Defense?

23:23.560 --> 23:32.560
 Laterpairs to indeed be a repaid of what we heard from these fillies in yesterday's trial.

23:33.560 --> 23:35.560
 I fail to see what you said, maybe.

23:40.560 --> 23:45.560
 Laterpairs to indeed be a repaid of what we heard from these fillies in yesterday's trial.

23:46.560 --> 23:48.560

24:21.560 --> 24:23.560
 Mm, a fair point.

24:24.560 --> 24:27.560
 Very well. You may begin your cross examination.

 A fair point. Very well. You may begin your cross examination.

25:02.560 --> 25:16.560
 And what happened afterward? And what happened afterward?

25:16.560 --> 25:36.560
 But that means that you stuck with your friend the whole time.

25:36.560 --> 25:42.560
 But that means that you stuck with your friend the whole time, right?

25:42.560 --> 25:48.560
 But that means that you stuck with your friend the whole time.
